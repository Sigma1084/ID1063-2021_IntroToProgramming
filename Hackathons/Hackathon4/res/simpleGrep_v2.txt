NAME
	simpleGrep - print lines that match pattern

SYNOPSIS
	simpleGrep [OPTION...] PATTERN FILE

DESCRIPTION
	simpleGrep searches for occurences of PATTERN in FILE. The string PATTERN
	will be provided within double-quotes.

	The PATTERN is a string consisting of one or more "printable" ascii characters.
	These are characters whose ascii code ranges from 32 to 126. The character '.' is
	to be treataed as a 'wildcard' character.

	The wildcard character '.' matches any one printable character. All other
	characters in PATTERN match themselves.
	
	There can be zero or more options given in any order. The last two command 
	line arguments will always be PATTERN and FILE.

OPTIONS
	-i	Ignore case. (i.e., lower case and upper case are treated the same)
	-v	Invert output. (i.e., all lines where pattern does not appear are considered a match)

OUTPUT
	simpleGrep outputs, in separate lines, each line number and line in FILE 
	that matches PATTERN. The format for output is:
	line number: line

	A line matches PATTERN if a substring in line matches PATTERN. However if -v option has been
	given, simpleGrep outputs each line number and line in FILE where PATTERN does not appear.

EXAMPLES
	Assume "alice.txt" contains the following:

	Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
	on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
	peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
	pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
	thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'

	$./simpleGrep "her" alice.txt

	3: peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no

	$./simpleGrep ".ing" alice.txt

	$./simpleGrep -i "A.d" alice.txt
	2: on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
	4: pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'

	$./simpleGrep -v "Alice" alice.txt
	2: on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
	3: peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
	4: pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'

	$./simpleGrep -v -i "t.e" alice.txt
