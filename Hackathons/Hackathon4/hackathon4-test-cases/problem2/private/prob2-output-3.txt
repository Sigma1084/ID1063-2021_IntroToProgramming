903: 
906: better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know
908: like a sky-rocket!'

935: 
939: found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
945: 
950: 
951:   It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and

1013: 
1017: 
1019: 
1024: 
1026: `Explain yourself!'
1027: 
1028:   `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because
1029: I'm not myself, you see.'
1030: 
1032: 
1033:   `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very
1035: being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
1036: 
1038: 
1042: feel it a little queer, won't you?'
1043: 
1045: 
1047: `all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
1048: 
1050: 
1055: 
1057: 
1061: 
1063: important to say!'
1064: 
1066: again.

1153: 
1155: 
1159: 
1163: 
1164:   `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
1166: easily offended!'
1167: 
1170: 
1175: remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and

1221: 
1231: 
1233: 
1234:   `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'
1235: 
1239: 
1241: Alice.
1242: 
1246: 
1249: 
1253: 
1255: beginning to see its meaning.
1256: 
1261: 
1262:   `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm
1263: a--'

1267: 
1270: 
1272: deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my

1279: serpents do, you know.'

1283: 
1288: serpent?'

1375: 
1380: 
1383: 
1385: 
1387: first question, you know.'
1388: 
1389:   It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
1392: 
1395: said, `on and off, for days and days.'
1396: 
1398: 
1400: 
1403: 
1408: be full of soup.
1409: 
1412: 
1418: ear to ear.
1419: 
1420:   `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for
1423: 
1425: 
1429: again:--

1487:                 `Wow! wow! wow!'
1488: 
1492: 
1493:         `I speak severely to my boy,

1499: 
1500:                 `Wow! wow! wow!'
1501: 
1507: 
1515: 
1521: to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it

1534:

1575: 
1578: 
1581: 
1585: 
1586:   `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
1587: 
1589: I'm mad.  You're mad.'
1590: 
1592: 
1594: 
1597: 
1600: 
1601:   `I suppose so,' said Alice.
1602: 
1606: 
1607:   `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.
1608: 
1611: 
1613: invited yet.'
1614: 
1616: 
1620: 
1622: nearly forgotten to ask.'
1623: 
1625: come back in a natural way.

1649: saw in my life!'

1665:                          A Mad Tea-Party
1666: 
1667: 
1673: `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'
1674: 
1680: 
1682: 
1685: 
1687: 
1689: angrily.
1690: 
1693: 
1694:   `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a

1710:

1714:   `Exactly so,' said Alice.

1773: could.
1774: 
1777: 
1780: remark myself.'
1781: 
1783: Alice again.
1784: 
1786: 
1788: 
1790: 
1793: have no answers.'
1794: 
1797: 
1799: 
1801: contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
1802: 
1805: 
1812: 
1815: 
1818: 
1821:

1867: 
1870: tells us a story.'
1871: 
1874: 
1877: 
1880: were saying.'
1881: 
1883: 
1884:   `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
1885: 
1887: again before it's done.'
1888: 
1892: 
1894: interest in questions of eating and drinking.
1895: 
1897: minute or two.
1898: 
1901: 
1903: 
1907: 
1909: earnestly.
1910: 
1912: I can't take more.'
1913: 
1916: 
1917:   `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

2100: 
2107: 
2109: `It's no business of MINE.'
2110: 
2113: Off--'
2114: 
2116: Queen was silent.

114:   There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
120: solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
122: doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or

1039:   `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but
1046:   `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;

1632: hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be
1640:   `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep
1643:   `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
1647:   `Well!  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;
1672: over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;
1694:   `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a
1702: with some severity; `it's very rude.'
1704:   The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all
1718:   `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what
1779: opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to
1890: Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,
1891: Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'
1900: remarked; `they'd have been ill.'
1902:   `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'
1935:   `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt
1961:   `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so
1968:   `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'
1974: rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
1984: off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
1996: up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
2034:   `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
2060: have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;
2069:   First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
2071: feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were
2073: soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were
2080: King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
2085: ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,
2094:   `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,
2098: politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of
2102: gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as
2187: against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or
2189: curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and
2190: furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
2211: quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
2219: me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great
2243: particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and
2244: you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;

2475: the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,

2519: see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,
2581: question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and
2599:   `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be

2658:   `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;
2708:   `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
2737: Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,
2815: in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle
2902: lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'
2907:     `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
2921:   `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it
2924:   Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her
2936:   `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was
3004:   `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon
3023: each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
3037:   The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown
3076: it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write
3077: with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very
3095:   `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit
3126:   `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;
3132:   `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or
3143: would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she
3320: to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
3321: it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it
3353: look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she
3381: the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has

5: 
6:                       Down the Rabbit-Hole
7: 
8: 
9:   Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
10: on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
11: peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
14: 
15:   So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
16: for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
17: the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
18: of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
19: Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
20: 
21:   There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
22: think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
24: it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
25: wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
26: but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
27: POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
28: her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
29: before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
30: take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
31: field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
32: down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
33: 
34:   In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
35: considering how in the world she was to get out again.
36: 
37:   The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
38: and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
39: moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
40: falling down a very deep well.
41: 
42:   Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
43: had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
44: wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look
45: down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
46: see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
47: noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
48: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She
49: took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
51: was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
52: somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
53: fell past it.
54: 
59: true.)
60: 
61:   Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I
63: `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
65: you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
66: lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
67: opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
68: listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,
71: or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
72: say.)
73: 
74:   Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right
76: people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
79: have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
82: through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what
85: 
86:   Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
89: her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were
93: rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
97: that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
98: was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
99: earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a
101: sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
102: 
103:   Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
104: moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her
105: was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
106: sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:
107: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
108: say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
110: corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found
111: herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
112: hanging from the roof.
113: 
114:   There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
115: and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
116: other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
117: wondering how she was ever to get out again.
118: 
119:   Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
120: solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
122: doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
123: the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
124: them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
125: curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
126: door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key
127: in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
128: 
129:   Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
130: passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and
131: looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
132: How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
133: among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
134: she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if
136: very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish
137: I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only
139: had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
140: things indeed were really impossible.
141: 
142:   There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
143: went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
144: it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
145: telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which
148: beautifully printed on it in large letters.
149: 
153: for she had read several nice little histories about children who
154: had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
155: things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
156: their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker
157: will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
158: finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had
159: never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
161: later.
162: 
164: to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
165: of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
166: turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished
167: it off.
168: 
169:      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
170: 
171:          *       *       *       *       *       *
172: 
173:      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
174: 
177: 
178:   And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and
179: her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
180: size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
181: First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
182: going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about
184: going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be
186: like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
187: ever having seen such a thing.
188: 
189:   After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
190: on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
191: when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the
192: little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,
193: she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it
194: quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb
195: up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
196: and when she had tired herself out with trying,
197: the poor little thing sat down and cried.
198: 
201: She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very
202: seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so
203: severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered
204: trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
205: of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious
210: 
211:   Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
212: the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on
215: I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
218: 
219:   She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
221: feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to
222: find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally
223: happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
224: way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
225: that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
226: common way.
227: 
228:   So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
229: 
230:      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
231: 
232:          *       *       *       *       *       *
233: 
234:      *       *       *       *       *       *       *

241:                         The Pool of Tears
242: 
243: 
245: surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
248: feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so
249: far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
251: be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
252: about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be
256: 
257:   And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
260: directions will look!
261: 
263:                 HEARTHRUG,
264:                     NEAR THE FENDER,
266: 
268: 
269:   Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in
270: fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took
271: up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
272: 
273:   Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one
274: side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get
275: through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to
276: cry again.
277: 
281: the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
282: all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the
283: hall.
284: 
285:   After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
286: distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
287: It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a
288: pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
289: other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
292: that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
293: came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,
295: gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
296: as he could go.
297: 
298:   Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
299: hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
300: `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday
302: the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this
303: morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
306: thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
307: as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
308: them.
309: 
315: things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,
316: and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!
317: I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the
319: London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,
322: and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,
323: and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and
324: strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--
325: 
326:             `How doth the little crocodile
327:               Improve his shining tail,
328:             And pour the waters of the Nile
329:               On every golden scale!
330: 
331:             `How cheerfully he seems to grin,
332:               How neatly spread his claws,
333:             And welcome little fishes in
335: 
337: her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel
338: after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
339: house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so
342: heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look
343: up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I
346: sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads
348: 
349:   As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was
351: white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done
353: and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
354: as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,
355: and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the
356: cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
357: hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
358: 
360: the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
362: back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut
363: again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
365: `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare
367: 
368:   As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another
369: moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first
370: idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that
372: been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general
373: conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
374: a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in
375: the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
376: behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that
377: she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
378: feet high.
379: 
381: trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I
382: suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer
384: 
385:   Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
386: little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at
387: first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
388: she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that
389: it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
390: 
392: mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should
396: (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:
397: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having
400: inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
401: eyes, but it said nothing.
402: 
406: no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she
408: her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
409: water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg
412: 
415: 
417: angry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:
420: as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so
421: nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and
424: for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
427: 
429: of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family
432: 
435: The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is
436: such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
437: A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly
444: Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and
445: making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
446: 
447:   So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back
450: slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice
451: thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to
454: 
455:   It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded
456: with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a
457: Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious
458: creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the
459: shore.
460:

463:                            CHAPTER III
464: 
465:                   A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
466: 
467: 
468:   They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the
469: bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their
470: fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
471: uncomfortable.
472: 
473:   The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they
474: had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed
475: quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
476: them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had
477: quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,
479: and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,
480: and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
481: more to be said.
482: 
483:   At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
486: ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes
487: anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad
488: cold if she did not get dry very soon.
489: 
491: This is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!
492: "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
493: soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been
494: of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and
496: 
498: 
501: 
503: 
505: Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:
506: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
508: 
510: 
513: 
517: 
518:   The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
519: `"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
521: moderate.  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you
523: spoke.
524: 
527: 
529: move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
531: 
535: some of the other birds tittered audibly.
536: 
539: 
541: to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
542: ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
543: 
545: (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
546: day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
547: 
548:   First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the
550: were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no `One,
552: and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
553: when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half
554: an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
557: 
558:   This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
559: thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
560: its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
561: in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At
562: last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
564: 
566: asked.
567: 
569: one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,
571: 
572:   Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
573: in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt
574: water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
575: There was exactly one a-piece all round.
576: 
578: 
581: 
583: 
585: 
586:   Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
587: solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
589: speech, they all cheered.
590: 
591:   Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
592: so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not
593: think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
594: looking as solemn as she could.
595: 
596:   The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise
597: and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
598: taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
599: the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
600: in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
601: 
604: afraid that it would be offended again.
605: 
607: Alice, and sighing.
608: 
611: she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
612: that her idea of the tale was something like this:--
613: 
614:                     `Fury said to a
615:                    mouse, That he
616:                  met in the
617:                house,
618:             "Let us
619:               both go to
620:                 law:  I will
621:                   prosecute
622:                     YOU.  --Come,
624:                         denial; We
625:                      must have a
626:                  trial:  For
627:               really this
629:           nothing
630:          to do."
631:            Said the
632:              mouse to the
633:                cur, "Such
634:                  a trial,
635:                    dear Sir,
636:                          With
637:                      no jury
638:                   or judge,
639:                 would be
640:               wasting
641:              our
642:               breath."
645:                    be jury,"
646:                          Said
647:                     cunning
648:                       old Fury:
650:                       try the
651:                          whole
652:                           cause,
653:                              and
654:                         condemn
655:                        you
656:                       to
658: 
659: 
662: 
665: 
667: 
670: 
673: 
676: 
677:   The Mouse only growled in reply.
678: 
681: the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
682: quicker.
683: 
685: was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of
686: saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you
690: 
693: 
695: said the Lory.
696: 
697:   Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about
702: 
703:   This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
704: Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one old Magpie began
705: wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be
707: called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
709: they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
710: 
715: began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
716: In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of
717: footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
718: that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to
719: finish his story.
720: 
721: 
722: 
723:                            CHAPTER IV
724: 
725:                 The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
726: 
727: 
728:   It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
729: looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
730: and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!
732: executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have
734: looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she
735: very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
736: nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her
737: swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
738: the little door, had vanished completely.
739: 
740:   Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
741: and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
742: you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
744: that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without
745: trying to explain the mistake it had made.
746: 
750: As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door
752: engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried
753: upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,
754: and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
755: gloves.
756: 
760: would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready
765: 
766:   By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
767: a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two
768: or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and
769: a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when
770: her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-
772: but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know
777: 
778:   It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:
779: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
780: against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
781: broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself
785: 
786:   Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and
787: growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in
788: another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried
789: the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the
790: other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,
791: as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one
792: foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,
794: 
795:   Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
796: effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,
797: and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
798: out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
799: 
804: this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
805: When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing
806: never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There
807: ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when
811: 
815: 
819: 
820:   And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,
821: and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
822: minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
823: 
826: stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and
827: she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she
828: was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no
829: reason to be afraid of it.
830: 
831:   Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;
833: hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it
835: 
837: fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly
838: spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not
839: get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,
840: and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was
841: just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
842: of the sort.
843: 
847: 
850: 
852: 
854: 
855:   `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it
857: 
859: 
862: 
863:   There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
866: last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in
867: the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more
868: sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there
872: 
873:   She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at
874: last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a
875: good many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:
880: Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind
886: 
888: Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
891: 
892:   She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
894: sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
896: sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
897: 
898:   The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes
903: 
907: is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes
909: 
911: 
915: 
916:   There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to
917: herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any
919: began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A
921: 
923: doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
924: rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
927: silence.
928: 
929:   Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
930: turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
935: 
936:   So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find
937: that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small
938: enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and
939: found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
940: The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by
941: two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
942: They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she
943: ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a
944: thick wood.
945: 
947: wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;
948: and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
950: 
951:   It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
952: simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the
953: smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering
954: about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over
955: her head made her look up in a great hurry.
956: 
957:   An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
958: eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
960: hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the
961: time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it
962: would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
963: 
964:   Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of
965: stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped
966: into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
967: and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice
968: dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run
969: over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy
970: made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in
971: its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very
972: like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
973: moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
974: again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
975: stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long
976: way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
977: down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its
978: mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
979: 
980:   This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;
981: so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out
983: distance.
984: 
986: leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself
987: with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks
990: me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
992: 
993:   The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round
994: her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see
995: anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
996: the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,
997: about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under
998: it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
999: that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
1000: 
1001:   She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of
1002: the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large
1003: caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,
1004: quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice
1005: of her or of anything else.
1006: 
1007: 
1008: 
1009:                             CHAPTER V
1010: 
1011:                     Advice from a Caterpillar
1012: 
1013: 
1014:   The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
1015: silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
1016: mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
1017: 
1019: 
1020:   This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice
1021: replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
1022: at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think
1024: 
1027: 
1030: 
1032: 
1036: 
1038: 
1040: when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you
1043: 
1045: 
1048: 
1050: 
1051:   Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
1053: making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,
1055: 
1057: 
1058:   Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not
1059: think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
1060: a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
1061: 
1064: 
1065:   This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back
1066: again.
1067: 
1069: 
1071: she could.
1072: 
1074: 
1075:   Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else
1076: to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
1077: hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but
1078: at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
1080: 
1083: 
1085: 
1088: 
1090: 
1091:   Alice folded her hands, and began:--
1092: 
1094:       `And your hair has become very white;
1095:     And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
1097: 
1099:       `I feared it might injure the brain;
1102: 
1104:       And have grown most uncommonly fat;
1105:     Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
1107: 
1109:       `I kept all my limbs very supple
1110:     By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
1112: 
1114:       For anything tougher than suet;
1115:     Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
1117: 
1119:       And argued each case with my wife;
1120:     And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
1122: 
1124:       That your eye was as steady as ever;
1125:     Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
1127: 
1130:     Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
1132: 
1133: 
1135: 
1138: 
1140: decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
1141: 
1142:   The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
1143: 
1145: 
1148: 
1150: 
1151:   Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in
1152: her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
1153: 
1155: 
1156:   `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you
1159: 
1161: angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three
1162: inches high).
1163: 
1167: 
1169: put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
1170: 
1171:   This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
1172: In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
1173: mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got
1174: down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely
1175: remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and
1177: 
1179: herself.
1180: 
1182: asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
1183: 
1184:   Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
1185: minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as
1186: it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.
1187: However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
1188: would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
1189: 
1191: little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment
1192: she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her
1193: foot!
1194: 
1195:   She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but
1196: she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
1197: rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
1198: Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was
1199: hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and
1200: managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.
1201: 
1202: 
1203:      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
1204: 
1205:          *       *       *       *       *       *
1206: 
1207:      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
1208: 
1210: delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she
1211: found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could
1212: see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which
1213: seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
1214: far below her.
1215: 
1217: HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
1219: result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
1220: distant green leaves.
1221: 
1222:   As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
1223: head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted
1224: to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,
1225: like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
1226: graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which
1227: she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
1228: had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
1229: hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating
1230: her violently with its wings.
1231: 
1233: 
1235: 
1239: 
1241: Alice.
1242: 
1246: 
1247:   Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no
1248: use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
1249: 
1251: Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and
1253: 
1255: beginning to see its meaning.
1256: 
1258: the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was
1259: thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come
1261: 
1264: 
1267: 
1269: remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
1270: 
1276: 
1278: truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
1280: 
1283: 
1284:   This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent
1285: for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
1289: 
1293: 
1295: settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the
1296: trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled
1297: among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and
1298: untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the
1299: pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very
1300: carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and
1301: growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
1302: succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
1303: 
1304:   It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,
1305: that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a
1306: few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,
1310: thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be
1312: open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
1314: upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their
1316: not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
1317: down to nine inches high.
1318: 
1319: 
1320: 
1321:                            CHAPTER VI
1322: 
1323:                          Pig and Pepper
1324: 
1325: 
1326:   For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
1327: wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
1328: running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman
1329: because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
1330: she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door
1331: with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,
1332: with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,
1333: Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their
1334: heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and
1335: crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
1336: 
1337:   The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great
1338: letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to
1339: the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An
1341: repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
1342: words a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess
1344: 
1345:   Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
1346: together.
1347: 
1348:   Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into
1349: the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped
1350: out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the
1351: ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
1352: 
1353:   Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
1354: 
1359: a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling
1360: and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish
1361: or kettle had been broken to pieces.
1362: 
1364: 
1366: on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For
1367: instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let
1369: he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But
1371: VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might
1373: 
1375: 
1376:   At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
1378: grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees
1379: behind him.
1380: 
1382: exactly as if nothing had happened.
1383: 
1385: 
1388: 
1389:   It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
1392: 
1393:   The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
1396: 
1398: 
1400: 
1403: 
1404:   The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of
1405: smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a
1406: three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was
1407: leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
1408: be full of soup.
1409: 
1411: herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
1412: 
1413:   There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the
1414: Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was
1416: only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,
1417: and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
1418: ear to ear.
1419: 
1421: she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
1423: 
1425: 
1426:   She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
1427: quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
1428: to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on
1429: again:--
1430: 
1433: 
1435: 
1437: feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
1438: 
1440: 
1441:   Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought
1442: it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
1443: conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took
1444: the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work
1445: throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
1446: --the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
1447: plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
1448: they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it
1449: was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
1450: 
1452: and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS
1454: nearly carried it off.
1455: 
1457: hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it
1459: 
1461: glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
1462: knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day
1463: and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn
1465: 
1467: 
1468:   Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant
1469: to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and
1470: seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four
1472: 
1475: singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a
1476: violent shake at the end of every line:
1477: 
1478:         `Speak roughly to your little boy,
1479:           And beat him when he sneezes:
1480:         He only does it to annoy,
1482: 
1483:                     CHORUS.
1484: 
1485:     (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
1486: 
1488: 
1489:   While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept
1490: tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing
1491: howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
1492: 
1493:         `I speak severely to my boy,
1494:           I beat him when he sneezes;
1495:         For he can thoroughly enjoy
1497: 
1498:                     CHORUS.
1499: 
1501: 
1503: to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and
1505: the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,
1506: but it just missed her.
1507: 
1508:   Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-
1509: shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all
1511: little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,
1512: and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,
1513: so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much
1514: as she could do to hold it.
1515: 
1516:   As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,
1517: (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep
1518: tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
1519: undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I
1526: 
1527:   The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into
1528: its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no
1529: doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout
1530: than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for
1531: a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
1533: into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
1534: 
1538: grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for
1539: some while in silence.
1540: 
1541:   Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I
1543: again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some
1544: alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was
1545: neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be
1546: quite absurd for her to carry it further.
1547: 
1548:   So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to
1550: she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:
1552: thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as
1553: pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right
1555: the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
1556: 
1557:   The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-
1558: natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great
1559: many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
1560: 
1562: all know whether it would like the name:  however, it only
1564: Alice, and she went on.  `Would you tell me, please, which way I
1566: 
1568: the Cat.
1569: 
1571: 
1573: 
1575: 
1578: 
1579:   Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
1581: 
1585: 
1587: 
1590: 
1592: 
1594: 
1597: 
1600: 
1602: 
1606: 
1608: 
1611: 
1614: 
1616: 
1617:   Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used
1618: to queer things happening.  While she was looking at the place
1619: where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
1620: 
1623: 
1625: come back in a natural way.
1626: 
1628: 
1629:   Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it
1630: did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the
1635: this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a
1636: branch of a tree.
1637: 
1639: 
1642: 
1644: beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,
1645: which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
1646: 
1650: 
1651:   She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
1652: house of the March Hare:  she thought it must be the right house,
1653: because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
1654: thatched with fur.  It was so large a house, that she did not
1655: like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
1656: bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even
1657: then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself
1660: 
1661: 
1662: 
1663:                            CHAPTER VII
1664: 
1665:                          A Mad Tea-Party
1666: 
1667: 
1668:   There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
1669: and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a
1670: Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
1671: were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking
1674: 
1675:   The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded
1678: Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one
1679: end of the table.
1680: 
1682: 
1683:   Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
1685: 
1687: 
1689: angrily.
1690: 
1693: 
1696: 
1698: looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was
1699: his first speech.
1700: 
1703: 
1704:   The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all
1706: 
1709: added aloud.
1710: 
1712: said the March Hare.
1713: 
1715: 
1717: 
1720: 
1722: as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
1724: 
1727: 
1729: be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
1731: 
1733: conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,
1734: while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
1736: 
1737:   The Hatter was the first to break the silence.  `What day of
1739: watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking
1740: it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
1741: 
1743: 
1746: Hare.
1747: 
1749: 
1752: 
1753:   The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then
1754: he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he
1755: could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It
1757: 
1758:   Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
1761: 
1764: 
1767: 
1769: 
1771: have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
1773: could.
1774: 
1776: a little hot tea upon its nose.
1777: 
1778:   The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without
1779: opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to
1781: 
1783: Alice again.
1784: 
1786: 
1788: 
1790: 
1791:   Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better
1794: 
1797: 
1799: 
1802: 
1805: 
1808: almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
1812: 
1814: whisper.)
1815: 
1818: 
1821: 
1823: 
1826: (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the
1827: great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
1828: 
1829:             "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
1831: 
1833: 
1835: 
1837: 
1838:             "Up above the world you fly,
1839:             Like a tea-tray in the sky.
1841: 
1842: Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
1844: they had to pinch it to make it stop.
1845: 
1849: 
1851: 
1854: 
1857: 
1860: 
1862: 
1864: 
1866: ventured to ask.
1867: 
1871: 
1873: the proposal.
1874: 
1877: 
1879: said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows
1881: 
1883: 
1885: 
1888: 
1890: Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,
1892: 
1894: interest in questions of eating and drinking.
1895: 
1897: minute or two.
1898: 
1901: 
1903: 
1904:   Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
1905: of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
1907: 
1909: earnestly.
1910: 
1913: 
1916: 
1918: 
1920: triumphantly.
1921: 
1922:   Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped
1923: herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the
1924: Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the
1926: 
1927:   The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
1929: 
1934: 
1937: 
1939: consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they
1941: 
1943: 
1945: time.
1946: 
1949: 
1950:   He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
1952: unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
1953: only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
1954: good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
1955: the milk-jug into his plate.
1956: 
1957:   Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began
1960: 
1962: I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,
1964: 
1966: choosing to notice this last remark.
1967: 
1969: 
1970:   This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse
1971: go on for some time without interrupting it.
1972: 
1974: rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
1976: 
1978: 
1980: 
1981:   Alice was silent.
1982: 
1983:   The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
1984: off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
1985: again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an
1986: M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
1987: you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever
1989: 
1992: 
1994: 
1995:   This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
1996: up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
1997: instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
1998: going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
1999: they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
2000: trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
2001: 
2005: 
2006:   Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
2009: And in she went.
2010: 
2011:   Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
2013: she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,
2014: and unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went
2015: to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it
2016: in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down
2017: the little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the
2018: beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.

2022:                           CHAPTER VIII
2023: 
2025: 
2026: 
2027:   A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the
2028: roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
2029: it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious
2030: thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
2033: 
2036: 
2039: 
2042: 
2044: 
2046: 
2049: 
2050:   Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all
2052: she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the
2053: others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
2054: 
2057: 
2058:   Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a
2059: low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to
2060: have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;
2061: and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads
2065: and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
2066: their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
2067: looked round, eager to see the Queen.
2068: 
2069:   First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
2070: like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
2071: feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were
2072: ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
2073: soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were
2074: ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
2075: in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next
2076: came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
2077: recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous
2078: manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
2079: noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
2081: grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
2082: 
2083:   Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
2084: her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember
2085: ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,
2088: So she stood still where she was, and waited.
2089: 
2090:   When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped
2092: She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
2093: 
2096: 
2100: 
2102: gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as
2103: they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs
2104: was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether
2105: they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her
2106: own children.
2107: 
2110: 
2111:   The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her
2112: for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!
2114: 
2116: Queen was silent.
2117: 
2118:   The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said
2120: 
2121:   The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
2123: 
2124:   The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
2125: 
2127: three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the
2128: King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.
2129: 
2131: And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you
2133: 
2136: 
2139: three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
2140: gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.
2141: 
2143: large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered
2144: about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly
2145: marched off after the others.
2146: 
2148: 
2150: shouted in reply.
2151: 
2153: 
2154:   The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question
2155: was evidently meant for her.
2156: 
2158: 
2160: procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
2161: 
2163: She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
2164: into her face.
2165: 
2167: 
2169: looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised
2170: himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
2172: 
2174: 
2176: 
2179: 
2182: frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came
2184: 
2186: and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
2187: against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or
2188: two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a
2189: curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and
2190: furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
2191: flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
2192: stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
2193: 
2194:   The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
2195: flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
2196: comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,
2197: but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
2198: out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
2199: WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a
2200: puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:
2201: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,
2202: it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
2203: itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,
2204: there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
2205: wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers
2206: were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
2207: ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
2208: difficult game indeed.
2209: 
2210:   The players all played at once without waiting for turns,
2211: quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
2212: a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
2215: 
2216:   Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as
2217: yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might
2221: 
2222:   She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering
2223: whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a
2224: curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at
2225: first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to
2228: 
2230: mouth enough for it to speak with.
2231: 
2235: and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the
2236: game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The
2237: Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and
2238: no more of it appeared.
2239: 
2243: particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and
2246: walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have
2249: 
2251: 
2253: she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so
2256: 
2257:   The Queen smiled and passed on.
2258: 
2261: 
2264: 
2267: 
2269: 
2272: 
2275: 
2277: he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I
2279: 
2280:   The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great
2282: round.
2283: 
2285: he hurried off.
2286: 
2287:   Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game
2289: screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three
2290: of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and
2291: she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in
2292: such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
2293: not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.
2294: 
2295:   The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
2296: which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
2297: of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her
2298: flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where
2299: Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
2300: into a tree.
2301: 
2302:   By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,
2303: the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:
2306: under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for
2307: a little more conversation with her friend.
2308: 
2309:   When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to
2310: find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute
2311: going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who
2312: were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,
2313: and looked very uncomfortable.
2314: 
2315:   The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to
2316: settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,
2317: though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed
2318: to make out exactly what they said.
2319: 
2321: head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had
2323: at HIS time of life.
2324: 
2327: 
2330: (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
2331: grave and anxious.)
2332: 
2333:   Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the
2335: 
2338: 
2340: by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
2341: disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
2342: looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
2343: 
2344: 
2345: 
2346:                            CHAPTER IX
2347: 
2349: 
2350: 
2354: 
2355:   Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and
2356: thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
2357: made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.
2358: 
2363: having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them
2364: sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar
2365: and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish
2368: 
2369:   She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a
2370: little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.
2374: 
2376: 
2380: 
2381:   Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,
2382: because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was
2384: and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not
2385: like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.
2386: 
2388: keeping up the conversation a little.
2389: 
2392: 
2395: 
2398: `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the
2400: 
2402: herself.
2403: 
2406: doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the
2408: 
2410: anxious to have the experiment tried.
2411: 
2413: bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock
2415: 
2417: 
2420: 
2422: 
2425: here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the
2427: 
2431: 
2434: more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
2435: what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
2436: been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
2438: 
2442: 
2444: replied, in a pleased tone.
2445: 
2447: said Alice.
2448: 
2451: 
2454: say it out loud.
2455: 
2457: sharp little chin.
2458: 
2460: beginning to feel a little worried.
2461: 
2464: 
2467: arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,
2468: and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,
2469: frowning like a thunderstorm.
2470: 
2472: voice.
2473: 
2475: the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,
2477: 
2478:   The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
2479: 
2481: was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her
2482: back to the croquet-ground.
2483: 
2485: and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,
2486: they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a
2488: 
2489:   All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
2490: quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his
2492: taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
2493: off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
2494: or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
2495: King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of
2496: execution.
2497: 
2498:   Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to
2500: 
2502: 
2504: 
2506: 
2509: 
2510:   As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low
2513: unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
2514: 
2515:   They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
2518: see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and
2520: leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like
2521: the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would
2522: be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
2523: Queen:  so she waited.
2524: 
2525:   The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the
2527: said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.
2528: 
2530: 
2533: 
2535: slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,
2537: 
2538:   They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
2539: distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,
2540: as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
2542: asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the
2545: 
2546:   So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with
2547: large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
2548: 
2551: 
2555: 
2556:   So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice
2559: 
2562: 
2563:   These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only
2565: the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very
2566: nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your
2568: more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
2569: 
2571: calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to
2572: school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call
2574: 
2576: 
2579: 
2580:   `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
2582: looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At
2583: last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!
2585: 
2588: 
2590: 
2592: 
2594: again.  The Mock Turtle went on.
2595: 
2596:   `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school
2598: 
2601: 
2603: 
2605: 
2607: 
2609: 
2611: Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at the
2613: 
2616: 
2619: 
2621: 
2623: Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--
2625: 
2627: 
2628:   The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never
2631: 
2633: 
2636: 
2637:   Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
2638: it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you
2640: 
2642: off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,
2643: with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old
2644: conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us
2646: 
2648: 
2651: 
2654: 
2657: 
2659: and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
2660: 
2662: hurry to change the subject.
2663: 
2666: 
2668: 
2671: 
2672:   This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a
2673: little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day
2675: 
2677: 
2679: 
2682: 
2683: 
2684: 
2685:                             CHAPTER X
2686: 
2687:                       The Lobster Quadrille
2688: 
2689: 
2690:   The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper
2691: across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for
2692: a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone
2694: and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
2695: his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on
2696: again:--
2697: 
2703: 
2705: 
2707: 
2710: 
2712: 
2714: 
2716: 
2719: 
2721: Gryphon.
2722: 
2724: 
2726: 
2728: 
2730: 
2732: capering wildly about.
2733: 
2735: 
2737: Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,
2738: who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat
2739: down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
2740: 
2742: 
2744: 
2746: 
2748: Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall
2750: 
2752: 
2753:   So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
2754: and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and
2755: waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle
2756: sang this, very slowly and sadly:--
2757: 
2758: 
2759: `"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
2761:  tail.
2762: See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
2763: They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the
2764: dance?
2765: 
2767: dance?
2769: dance?
2770: 
2771: 
2772: "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
2773: When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to
2774:                                                       sea!"
2775: But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look
2776:                                                        askance--
2777: Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the
2778:    dance.
2779:     Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join
2780:         the dance.
2781:     Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join
2782:         the dance.
2783: 
2784: `"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
2785: "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
2786: The further off from England the nearer is to France--
2787: Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
2788: 
2790:          dance?
2793: 
2794: 
2795: 
2797: Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so
2799: 
2802: 
2804: checked herself hastily.
2805: 
2809: 
2812: 
2814: `crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE their tails
2816: yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all
2818: 
2820: the lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So
2821: they had to fall a long way.  So they got their tails fast in
2823: 
2826: 
2829: 
2831: 
2833: solemnly.
2834: 
2836: repeated in a wondering tone.
2837: 
2840: 
2841:   Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she
2843: 
2846: 
2848: curiosity.
2849: 
2852: 
2856: 
2859:

2863: to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With

2867: 
2871: 
2875: 
2877: 
2880: 
2881:   So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
2882: she first saw the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about
2883: it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on
2884: each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she
2885: gained courage as she went on.  Her listeners were perfectly
2886: quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,
2888: different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said
2890: 
2892: 
2894: thoughtfully.  `I should like to hear her try and repeat
2896: if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
2897: 
2899: the Gryphon.
2900: 
2901:   `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
2903: However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so
2904: full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was
2905: saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--
2906: 
2908:     "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
2909:     As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
2911: 
2912:               [later editions continued as follows
2913:     When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
2914:     And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
2915:     But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
2916:     His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
2917: 
2919: said the Gryphon.
2920: 
2923: 
2924:   Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her
2925: hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
2926: again.
2927: 
2929: 
2932: 
2935: 
2937: dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the
2938: subject.
2939: 
2942: 
2943:   Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would
2944: all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
2945: 
2946:     `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
2948: 
2949:         [later editions continued as follows
2950:     The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
2951:     While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
2952:     When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
2953:     Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
2954:     While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
2955:     And concluded the banquet--]
2956: 
2960: 
2962: Alice was only too glad to do so.
2963: 
2965: Gryphon went on.  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you
2967: 
2969: Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather
2970: offended tone, `Hm!  No accounting for tastes!  Sing her
2972: 
2973:   The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes
2974: choked with sobs, to sing this:--
2975: 
2976: 
2977:     `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
2978:     Waiting in a hot tureen!
2979:     Who for such dainties would not stoop?
2980:     Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2981:     Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2982:         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2983:         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2984:     Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2985:         Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
2986: 
2987:     `Beautiful Soup!  Who cares for fish,
2988:     Game, or any other dish?
2989:     Who would not give all else for two
2990:     Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2991:     Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2992:         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!

2994:     Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,

3000: 
3002: it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.
3003: 
3006: faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the
3007: melancholy words:--
3008: 
3009:     `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,

3014:                            CHAPTER XI
3015: 
3016:                       Who Stole the Tarts?
3017: 
3018: 
3019:   The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
3020: they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts
3021: of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
3022: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
3023: each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
3024: with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
3025: other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
3026: dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice
3029: to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
3030: her, to pass away the time.
3031: 
3032:   Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had
3033: read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that
3036: 
3037:   The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown
3038: over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
3039: did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly
3040: not becoming.
3041: 
3044: some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they
3046: to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and
3047: rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
3049: as well.
3050: 
3051:   The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
3054: 
3056: reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the
3058: 
3060: she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in
3062: anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
3063: 
3064:   Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their
3066: on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them
3070: 
3071:   One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,
3072: Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got
3073: behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
3074: away.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was
3075: Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of
3076: it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write
3077: with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very
3078: little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
3079: 
3081: 
3082:   On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
3083: then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
3084: 
3085:     `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
3086:           All on a summer day:
3087:       The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
3089: 
3091: 
3094: 
3096: blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First
3098: 
3099:   The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in
3100: one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg
3103: 
3106: 
3107:   The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into
3108: the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I
3110: 
3112: 
3114: 
3116: eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then
3117: added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
3118: 
3120: 
3122: 
3124: instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
3125: 
3128: 
3129:   Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the
3130: Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
3131: 
3134: 
3135:   This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept
3136: shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the
3137: Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
3138: teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
3139: 
3140:   Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which
3141: puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was
3142: beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she
3143: would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she
3144: decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
3145: her.
3146: 
3149: 
3151: 
3153: 
3156: 
3159: and crossed over to the other side of the court.
3160: 
3161:   All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
3162: Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to
3163: one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the
3165: trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
3166: 
3169: 
3172: or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and
3174: 
3176: 
3178: 
3181: 
3184: 
3186: 
3188: 
3190: 
3192: 
3194: looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the
3195: Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
3196: 
3199: 
3201: 
3203: 
3206: 
3207:   The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,
3209: began.
3210: 
3212: 
3213:   Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately
3214: suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a
3215: hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had
3216: a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
3217: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
3218: upon it.)
3219: 
3221: read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
3222: attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
3223: officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant
3225: 
3227: continued the King.
3228: 
3231: 
3233: 
3234:   Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
3235: 
3238: 
3240: look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
3241: 
3243: court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.
3244: 
3246: of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
3247: officer could get to the door.
3248: 
3250: 
3252: pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
3253: she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
3254: sneezing all at once.
3255: 
3257: 
3259: 
3260:   The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
3262: 
3264: air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
3265: his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What
3267: 
3269: 
3271: 
3273: Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
3275: 
3276:   For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
3277: Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
3278: again, the cook had disappeared.
3279: 
3282: Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
3284: 
3285:   Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
3286: feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
3288: Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
3290:

3293:                            CHAPTER XII
3294: 
3296: 
3297: 
3299: moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
3300: jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with
3301: the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
3302: of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
3303: her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
3304: the week before.
3305: 
3307: dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
3308: for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
3309: she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
3310: and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
3311: 
3313: voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
3315: he said do.
3316: 
3317:   Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she
3318: had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
3319: was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
3320: to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
3323: 
3324:   As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
3325: being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
3326: handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
3327: out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
3328: too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
3329: gazing up into the roof of the court.
3330: 
3332: Alice.
3333: 
3335: 
3337: 
3339: 
3341: They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
3342: the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
3344: making faces at him as he spoke.
3345: 
3347: went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
3349: sounded best.
3350: 
3354: thought to herself.
3355: 
3356:   At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
3358: from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
3360: 
3361:   Everybody looked at Alice.
3362: 
3364: 
3366: 
3368: 
3371: 
3373: 
3375: 
3376:   The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
3378: voice.
3379: 
3381: the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
3383: 
3385: 
3388: 
3391: 
3393: 
3398: 
3400: the jurymen.
3401: 
3404: 
3406: (The jury all brightened up again.)
3407: 
3410: 
3414: 
3415:   There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
3416: first really clever thing the King had said that day.
3417: 
3419: 
3422: 
3424: 
3425:   The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,
3427: 
3430: 
3431:   These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
3432: 
3433:         `They told me you had been to her,
3434:           And mentioned me to him:
3435:         She gave me a good character,
3436:           But said I could not swim.
3437: 
3438:         He sent them word I had not gone
3439:           (We know it to be true):
3440:         If she should push the matter on,
3441:           What would become of you?
3442: 
3443:         I gave her one, they gave him two,
3444:           You gave us three or more;
3445:         They all returned from him to you,
3446:           Though they were mine before.
3447: 
3448:         If I or she should chance to be
3449:           Involved in this affair,
3450:         He trusts to you to set them free,
3451:           Exactly as we were.
3452: 
3453:         My notion was that you had been
3454:           (Before she had this fit)
3455:         An obstacle that came between
3456:           Him, and ourselves, and it.
3457: 
3459:           For this must ever be
3460:         A secret, kept from all the rest,
3462: 
3465: 
3470: 
3473: explain the paper.
3474: 
3478: knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
3479: meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you
3481: 
3483: (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
3484: 
3487: the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,
3489: 
3491: Alice.
3492: 
3494: the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
3495: Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my
3497: 
3499: Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
3500: writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
3501: mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
3502: trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
3503: 
3505: the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.
3506: 
3509: King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
3510: 
3512: 
3515: 
3517: 
3519: 
3521: Nobody moved.
3522: 
3525: 
3526:   At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
3527: down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
3528: of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
3529: the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
3530: brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
3531: trees upon her face.
3532: 
3535: 
3537: her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
3538: Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
3539: when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
3542: ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
3543: 
3544:   But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
3545: head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
3546: little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
3547: dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--
3548: 
3549:   First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
3550: tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
3551: were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
3552: voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
3553: the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
3554: still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
3555: around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
3557: 
3558:   The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
3559: by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
3560: neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
3561: the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
3562: and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
3563: guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
3566: slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
3567: filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
3568: Mock Turtle.
3569: 
3570:   So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
3571: Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
3572: all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
3573: rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
3574: reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
3576: boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
3577: all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
3578: confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
3580: heavy sobs.
3581: 
3582:   Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
3583: hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
3584: she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
3585: loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
3586: her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
3587: with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
3588: Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
3589: simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
3590: remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
3591: 
3592:                              THE END
1670: Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
2515:   They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
3195: Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

10: it was the epoch of belief,
11: it was the epoch of incredulity,
12: it was the season of Light,
13: it was the season of Darkness,
14: it was the spring of hope,
15: it was the winter of despair,
16: we had everything before us,
17: we had nothing before us,
18: we were all going direct to Heaven,
19: we were all going direct the other way--
20: in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
21: its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
22: evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
23: 
24: There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
25: throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
26: a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
27: than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
28: that things in general were settled for ever.
29: 
30: It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
31: Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
32: as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
33: blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
34: heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
35: made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
36: ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
37: messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
38: deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
39: earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
40: from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
41: to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
42: communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
43: brood.
44: 
45: France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
46: sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
47: hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
48: Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
49: achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
50: torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
51: kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
52: which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
53: yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
54: Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
55: already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
56: boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
57: it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
58: of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
59: sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
60: rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
61: the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
62: the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
63: unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
64: with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
65: that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
66: 
67: In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
68: justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
69: highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
70: families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
71: their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
72: in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
73: challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
74: "the Captain," gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
75: mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
76: then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in consequence of the
77: failure of his ammunition:" after which the mail was robbed in peace;
78: that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
79: and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
80: illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
81: gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
82: fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
83: thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
84: Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
85: for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
86: musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
87: much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
88: and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
89: up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
90: Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
91: hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
92: Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
93: and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
94: sixpence.
95: 
96: All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
97: upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
98: Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
99: those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
100: fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
101: with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
102: and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
103: creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
104: roads that lay before them.
105: 
106: 
107: 
108: 
109: II. The Mail
110: 
111: 
112: It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
113: before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
114: The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
115: Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
116: as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
117: for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
118: and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
119: horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
120: coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
121: to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
122: combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
123: otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
124: are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
125: their duty.
126: 
127: With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
128: the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
129: falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
130: them and brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the
131: near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
132: unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
133: hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
134: nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
135: 
136: There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
137: forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
138: none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
139: air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
140: waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out
141: everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
142: and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
143: into it, as if they had made it all.
144: 
145: Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
146: side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
147: ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from
148: anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
149: hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
150: the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers
151: were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
152: the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,
153: when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
154: "the Captain's" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
155: non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard
156: of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
157: thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as
158: he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
159: and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
160: loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
161: deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
162: 
163: The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
164: the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
165: all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
166: the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
167: taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
168: journey.
169: 
170: "Wo-ho!" said the coachman. "So, then! One more pull and you're at the
171: top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
172: it!--Joe!"
173: 
174: "Halloa!" the guard replied.
175: 
176: "What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"
177: 
178: "Ten minutes, good, past eleven."
179: 
180: "My blood!" ejaculated the vexed coachman, "and not atop of Shooter's
181: yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!"
182: 
183: The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
184: made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
185: suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
186: passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach
187: stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three
188: had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
189: into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of
190: getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
191: 
192: The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
193: stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
194: the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
195: 
196: "Tst! Joe!" cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his
197: box.
198: 
199: "What do you say, Tom?"
200: 
201: They both listened.
202: 
203: "I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."
204: 
205: "_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom," returned the guard, leaving his hold
206: of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. "Gentlemen! In the king's
207: name, all of you!"
208: 
209: With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on
210: the offensive.
211: 
212: The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
213: the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He
214: remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
215: in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
216: and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked
217: back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
218: his ears and looked back, without contradicting.
219: 
220: The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
221: of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
222: indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
223: the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the
224: passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
225: quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
226: the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
227: 
228: The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
229: 
230: "So-ho!" the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. "Yo there! Stand!
231: I shall fire!"
232: 
233: The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
234: a man's voice called from the mist, "Is that the Dover mail?"
235: 
236: "Never you mind what it is!" the guard retorted. "What are you?"
237: 
238: "_Is_ that the Dover mail?"
239: 
240: "Why do you want to know?"
241: 
242: "I want a passenger, if it is."
243: 
244: "What passenger?"
245: 
246: "Mr. Jarvis Lorry."
247: 
248: Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,
249: the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.
250: 
251: "Keep where you are," the guard called to the voice in the mist,
252: "because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
253: your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."
254: 
255: "What is the matter?" asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
256: speech. "Who wants me? Is it Jerry?"
257: 
258: ("I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry," growled the guard to
259: himself. "He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.")
260: 
261: "Yes, Mr. Lorry."
262: 
263: "What is the matter?"
264: 
265: "A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co."
266: 
267: "I know this messenger, guard," said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
268: road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
269: passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
270: pulled up the window. "He may come close; there's nothing wrong."
271: 
272: "I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that," said the
273: guard, in gruff soliloquy. "Hallo you!"
274: 
275: "Well! And hallo you!" said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.
276: 
277: "Come on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that
278: saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil
279: at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So
280: now let's look at you."
281: 
282: The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
283: and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider
284: stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
285: a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and
286: rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
287: the man.
288: 
289: "Guard!" said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.
290: 
291: The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
292: blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,
293: answered curtly, "Sir."
294: 
295: "There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must
296: know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown
297: to drink. I may read this?"
298: 
299: "If so be as you're quick, sir."
300: 
301: He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
302: read--first to himself and then aloud: "'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.'
303: It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
304: TO LIFE."
305: 
306: Jerry started in his saddle. "That's a Blazing strange answer, too,"
307: said he, at his hoarsest.
308: 
309: "Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
310: well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night."
311: 
312: With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
313: all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
314: their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
315: pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape
316: the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
317: 
318: The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
319: it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
320: in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
321: having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
322: looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a
323: few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was
324: furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
325: and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
326: himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
327: and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in
328: five minutes.
329: 
330: "Tom!" softly over the coach roof.
331: 
332: "Hallo, Joe."
333: 
334: "Did you hear the message?"
335: 
336: "I did, Joe."
337: 
338: "What did you make of it, Tom?"
339: 
340: "Nothing at all, Joe."
341: 
342: "That's a coincidence, too," the guard mused, "for I made the same of it
343: myself."
344: 
345: Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
346: only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
347: shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of
348: holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his
349: heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
350: hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the
351: hill.
352: 
353: "After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your
354: fore-legs till I get you on the level," said this hoarse messenger,
355: glancing at his mare. "'Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange
356: message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd
357: be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
358: Jerry!"
359: 
360: 
361: 
362: 
363: III. The Night Shadows
364: 
365: 
366: A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
367: constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
368: solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
369: one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
370: room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
371: heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
372: its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the
373: awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I
374: turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
375: to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
376: water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
377: of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the
378: book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
379: but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
380: eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
381: in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
382: my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
383: consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
384: individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In
385: any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
386: a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
387: innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
388: 
389: As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
390: messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
391: first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
392: three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
393: coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
394: been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
395: breadth of a county between him and the next.
396: 
397: The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
398: ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
399: own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that
400: assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
401: no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
402: were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
403: far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
404: a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
405: throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he stopped
406: for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he
407: poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he
408: muffled again.
409: 
410: "No, Jerry, no!" said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.
411: "It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't
412: suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he'd
413: been a drinking!"
414: 
415: His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several
416: times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
417: which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
418: over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
419: so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
420: wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
421: have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
422: 
423: While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
424: watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who
425: was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
426: night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such
427: shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.
428: They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
429: 
430: What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
431: its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
432: likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
433: their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
434: 
435: Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank
436: passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
437: lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,
438: and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special
439: jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
440: coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
441: bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
442: stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
443: and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with
444: all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then
445: the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable
446: stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a
447: little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among
448: them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
449: safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
450: 
451: But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach
452: (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
453: always with him, there was another current of impression that never
454: ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
455: out of a grave.
456: 
457: Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
458: was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
459: not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
460: years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
461: and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,
462: defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
463: so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
464: and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
465: prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
466: spectre:
467: 
468: "Buried how long?"
469: 
470: The answer was always the same: "Almost eighteen years."
471: 
472: "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"
473: 
474: "Long ago."
475: 
476: "You know that you are recalled to life?"
477: 
478: "They tell me so."
479: 
480: "I hope you care to live?"
481: 
482: "I can't say."
483: 
484: "Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?"
485: 
486: The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes
487: the broken reply was, "Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon."
488: Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
489: "Take me to her." Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
490: was, "I don't know her. I don't understand."
491: 
492: After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
493: and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
494: hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
495: hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The
496: passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
497: reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
498: 
499: Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
500: patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
501: by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
502: of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
503: real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
504: sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out
505: of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost
506: it again.
507: 
508: "Buried how long?"
509: 
510: "Almost eighteen years."
511: 
512: "I hope you care to live?"
513: 
514: "I can't say."
515: 
516: Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
517: passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
518: securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
519: slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again
520: slid away into the bank and the grave.
521: 
522: "Buried how long?"
523: 
524: "Almost eighteen years."
525: 
526: "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"
527: 
528: "Long ago."
529: 
530: The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
531: his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary
532: passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
533: shadows of the night were gone.
534: 
535: He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a
536: ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
537: last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
538: in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
539: upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
540: and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.
541: 
542: "Eighteen years!" said the passenger, looking at the sun. "Gracious
543: Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!"
544: 
545: 
546: 
547: 
548: IV. The Preparation
549: 
550: 
551: When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
552: the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his
553: custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
554: from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
555: traveller upon.
556: 
557: By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
558: congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
559: roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
560: and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
561: like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
562: of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
563: muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
564: 
565: "There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?"
566: 
567: "Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
568: tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,
569: sir?"
570: 
571: "I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber."
572: 
573: "And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.
574: Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off
575: gentleman's boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)
576: Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!"
577: 
578: The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
579: mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
580: head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
581: Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
582: all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another
583: drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
584: loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
585: and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
586: brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
587: square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to
588: his breakfast.
589: 
590: The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
591: in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,
592: with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,
593: that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
594: 
595: Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
596: loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,
597: as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
598: evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
599: of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
600: fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He
601: wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his
602: head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
603: looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
604: His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,
605: was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
606: beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A
607: face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
608: quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
609: their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
610: reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. He had a healthy colour in his
611: cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
612: But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were
613: principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
614: second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.
615: 
616: Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
617: Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,
618: and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:
619: 
620: "I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
621: time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a
622: gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know."
623: 
624: "Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?"
625: 
626: "Yes."
627: 
628: "Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
629: their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A
630: vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House."
631: 
632: "Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one."
633: 
634: "Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
635: sir?"
636: 
637: "Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
638: from France."
639: 
640: "Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's
641: time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir."
642: 
643: "I believe so."
644: 
645: "But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
646: Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
647: years ago?"
648: 
649: "You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
650: the truth."
651: 
652: "Indeed, sir!"
653: 
654: Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the
655: table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,
656: dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
657: he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the
658: immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.
659: 
660: When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
661: the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
662: from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
663: ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
664: wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
665: destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
666: brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong
667: a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
668: dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little
669: fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
670: night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
671: made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
672: sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
673: that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
674: 
675: As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
676: at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
677: again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud
678: too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
679: his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,
680: digging, digging, in the live red coals.
681: 
682: A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
683: harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
684: Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
685: glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
686: ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
687: got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
688: street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.
689: 
690: He set down his glass untouched. "This is Mam'selle!" said he.
691: 
692: In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
693: had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
694: Tellson's.
695: 
696: "So soon?"
697: 
698: Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
699: then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's
700: immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.
701: 
702: The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his
703: glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen
704: wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment.
705: It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
706: horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and
707: oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
708: were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
709: graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
710: from them until they were dug out.
711: 
712: The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his
713: way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
714: the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
715: candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
716: the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
717: and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As
718: his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
719: hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and
720: a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth
721: it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
722: not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
723: fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his
724: eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,
725: of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
726: Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
727: high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
728: the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital
729: procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
730: offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
731: feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.
732: 
733: "Pray take a seat, sir." In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
734: little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
735: 
736: "I kiss your hand, miss," said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
737: date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
738: 
739: "I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
740: some intelligence--or discovery--"
741: 
742: "The word is not material, miss; either word will do."
743: 
744: "--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
745: long dead--"
746: 
747: Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
748: hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for
749: anybody in their absurd baskets!
750: 
751: "--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
752: with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
753: the purpose."
754: 
755: "Myself."
756: 
757: "As I was prepared to hear, sir."
758: 
759: She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a
760: pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
761: was than she. He made her another bow.
762: 
763: "I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
764: those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
765: France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
766: me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
767: during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. The
768: gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to
769: beg the favour of his waiting for me here."
770: 
771: "I was happy," said Mr. Lorry, "to be entrusted with the charge. I shall
772: be more happy to execute it."
773: 
774: "Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me
775: by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
776: business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
777: nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
778: strong and eager interest to know what they are."
779: 
780: "Naturally," said Mr. Lorry. "Yes--I--"
781: 
782: After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
783: ears, "It is very difficult to begin."
784: 
785: He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
786: forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
787: and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,
788: as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
789: shadow.
790: 
791: "Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?"
792: 
793: "Am I not?" Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with
794: an argumentative smile.
795: 
796: Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
797: which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
798: deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
799: she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the
800: moment she raised her eyes again, went on:
801: 
802: "In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
803: as a young English lady, Miss Manette?"
804: 
805: "If you please, sir."
806: 
807: "Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
808: acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than
809: if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with
810: your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers."
811: 
812: "Story!"
813: 
814: He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,
815: in a hurry, "Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
816: our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific
817: gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor."
818: 
819: "Not of Beauvais?"
820: 
821: "Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
822: gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
823: gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.
824: Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that
825: time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years."
826: 
827: "At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?"
828: 
829: "I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and
830: I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
831: French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands.
832: In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
833: scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;
834: there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
835: sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
836: business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
837: the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
838: machine. To go on--"
839: 
840: "But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think"--the
841: curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--"that when I was
842: left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years,
843: it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you."
844: 
845: Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
846: to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
847: conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
848: the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub
849: his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking
850: down into her face while she sat looking up into his.
851: 
852: "Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
853: just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
854: with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
855: that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of
856: Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
857: Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
858: of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
859: Mangle."
860: 
861: After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
862: flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most
863: unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
864: before), and resumed his former attitude.
865: 
866: "So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your
867: regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died
868: when he did--Don't be frightened! How you start!"
869: 
870: She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
871: 
872: "Pray," said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from
873: the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
874: him in so violent a tremble: "pray control your agitation--a matter of
875: business. As I was saying--"
876: 
877: Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:
878: 
879: "As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly
880: and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not
881: been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
882: trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
883: privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
884: to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
885: privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
886: to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had
887: implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
888: him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
889: been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais."
890: 
891: "I entreat you to tell me more, sir."
892: 
893: "I will. I am going to. You can bear it?"
894: 
895: "I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
896: moment."
897: 
898: "You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That's good!" (Though
899: his manner was less satisfied than his words.) "A matter of business.
900: Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now
901: if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,
902: had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
903: born--"
904: 
905: "The little child was a daughter, sir."
906: 
907: "A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don't be distressed. Miss, if the
908: poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
909: that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
910: inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by
911: rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don't kneel! In
912: Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!"
913: 
914: "For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!"
915: 
916: "A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
917: business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
918: mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
919: shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
920: much more at my ease about your state of mind."
921: 
922: Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
923: very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
924: his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
925: communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
926: 
927: "That's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before
928: you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
929: you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
930: her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
931: to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
932: upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
933: heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years."
934: 
935: As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
936: flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have
937: been already tinged with grey.
938: 
939: "You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
940: they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new
941: discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--"
942: 
943: He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
944: forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
945: now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
946: 
947: "But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too
948: probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
949: Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
950: in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to
951: restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort."
952: 
953: A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a
954: low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,
955: 
956: "I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!"
957: 
958: Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. "There, there,
959: there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.
960: You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair
961: sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side."
962: 
963: She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, "I have been free, I
964: have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!"
965: 
966: "Only one thing more," said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
967: wholesome means of enforcing her attention: "he has been found under
968: another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
969: worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
970: know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
971: held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
972: because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,
973: anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all
974: events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
975: Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
976: the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
977: to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,
978: and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;'
979: which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn't notice a
980: word! Miss Manette!"
981: 
982: Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
983: sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
984: upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
985: branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
986: feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
987: out loudly for assistance without moving.
988: 
989: A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
990: be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
991: extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most
992: wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
993: or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
994: inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
995: poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him
996: flying back against the nearest wall.
997: 
998: ("I really think this must be a man!" was Mr. Lorry's breathless
999: reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)
1000: 
1001: "Why, look at you all!" bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
1002: "Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
1003: at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don't you go and fetch
1004: things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold
1005: water, and vinegar, quick, I will."
1006: 
1007: There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
1008: softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
1009: gentleness: calling her "my precious!" and "my bird!" and spreading her
1010: golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.
1011: 
1012: "And you in brown!" she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
1013: "couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
1014: to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
1015: you call _that_ being a Banker?"
1016: 
1017: Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
1018: answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
1019: sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
1020: servants under the mysterious penalty of "letting them know" something
1021: not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a
1022: regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
1023: upon her shoulder.
1024: 
1025: "I hope she will do well now," said Mr. Lorry.
1026: 
1027: "No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!"
1028: 
1029: "I hope," said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
1030: humility, "that you accompany Miss Manette to France?"
1031: 
1032: "A likely thing, too!" replied the strong woman. "If it was ever
1033: intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
1034: would have cast my lot in an island?"
1035: 
1036: This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
1037: consider it.
1038: 
1039: 
1040: 
1041: 
1042: V. The Wine-shop
1043: 
1044: 
1045: A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
1046: accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
1047: out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
1048: outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
1049: 
1050: All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
1051: idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
1052: stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
1053: thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
1054: had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
1055: jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
1056: made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
1057: women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
1058: run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in
1059: the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
1060: handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants'
1061: mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
1062: others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
1063: there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
1064: directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
1065: pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
1066: fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the
1067: wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
1068: along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
1069: if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
1070: presence.
1071: 
1072: A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
1073: and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There
1074: was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a
1075: special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
1076: of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
1077: luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
1078: shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
1079: together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
1080: most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
1081: demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who
1082: had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
1083: motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
1084: hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
1085: starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
1086: with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
1087: the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
1088: gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.
1089: 
1090: The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
1091: in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had
1092: stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
1093: wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
1094: on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was
1095: stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.
1096: Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
1097: tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his
1098: head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
1099: upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.
1100: 
1101: The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
1102: street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
1103: 
1104: And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
1105: gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
1106: heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
1107: waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
1108: but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a
1109: terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
1110: fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
1111: passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
1112: in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which
1113: had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
1114: children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
1115: grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
1116: was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out
1117: of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
1118: lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
1119: paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
1120: firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
1121: chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
1122: among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the
1123: baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
1124: bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
1125: was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
1126: chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
1127: farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
1128: drops of oil.
1129: 
1130: Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
1131: street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
1132: diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
1133: and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
1134: that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
1135: wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
1136: slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
1137: compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
1138: into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
1139: inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
1140: were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman
1141: painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
1142: meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
1143: croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
1144: gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
1145: flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives
1146: and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the
1147: gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,
1148: with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
1149: broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down
1150: the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
1151: rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across
1152: the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
1153: pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
1154: and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
1155: manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and
1156: the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.
1157: 
1158: For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
1159: should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
1160: long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
1161: up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
1162: condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
1163: France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
1164: song and feather, took no warning.
1165: 
1166: The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
1167: appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
1168: it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
1169: for the lost wine. "It's not my affair," said he, with a final shrug
1170: of the shoulders. "The people from the market did it. Let them bring
1171: another."
1172: 
1173: There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
1174: he called to him across the way:
1175: 
1176: "Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?"
1177: 
1178: The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
1179: the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
1180: often the way with his tribe too.
1181: 
1182: "What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?" said the wine-shop
1183: keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
1184: mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. "Why do you write
1185: in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
1186: to write such words in?"
1187: 
1188: In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,
1189: perhaps not) upon the joker's heart. The joker rapped it with his
1190: own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
1191: attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
1192: hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
1193: practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
1194: 
1195: "Put it on, put it on," said the other. "Call wine, wine; and finish
1196: there." With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's
1197: dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
1198: his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
1199: 
1200: This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
1201: and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
1202: bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
1203: His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
1204: the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
1205: crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good
1206: eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on
1207: the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
1208: resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
1209: down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
1210: the man.
1211: 
1212: Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
1213: came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
1214: a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
1215: heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
1216: manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
1217: have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
1218: in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being
1219: sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
1220: shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
1221: earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
1222: her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
1223: by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
1224: coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
1225: of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
1226: line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
1227: shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
1228: he stepped over the way.
1229: 
1230: The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
1231: rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
1232: a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
1233: dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
1234: of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
1235: elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, "This is our man."
1236: 
1237: "What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?" said Monsieur Defarge
1238: to himself; "I don't know you."
1239: 
1240: But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
1241: with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.
1242: 
1243: "How goes it, Jacques?" said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. "Is
1244: all the spilt wine swallowed?"
1245: 
1246: "Every drop, Jacques," answered Monsieur Defarge.
1247: 
1248: When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
1249: picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
1250: and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
1251: 
1252: "It is not often," said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
1253: Defarge, "that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
1254: of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?"
1255: 
1256: "It is so, Jacques," Monsieur Defarge returned.
1257: 
1258: At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
1259: using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
1260: cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
1261: 
1262: The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
1263: drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
1264: 
1265: "Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
1266: always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
1267: right, Jacques?"
1268: 
1269: "You are right, Jacques," was the response of Monsieur Defarge.
1270: 
1271: This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
1272: when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
1273: slightly rustled in her seat.
1274: 
1275: "Hold then! True!" muttered her husband. "Gentlemen--my wife!"
1276: 
1277: The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
1278: flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
1279: giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
1280: wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
1281: of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
1282: 
1283: "Gentlemen," said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
1284: upon her, "good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
1285: wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
1286: fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
1287: close to the left here," pointing with his hand, "near to the window of
1288: my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
1289: there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!"
1290: 
1291: They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
1292: Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
1293: gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.
1294: 
1295: "Willingly, sir," said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
1296: the door.
1297: 
1298: Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
1299: word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had
1300: not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
1301: beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
1302: knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
1303: 
1304: Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
1305: joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
1306: company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
1307: and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
1308: by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
1309: gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
1310: to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was
1311: a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
1312: transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour
1313: in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
1314: angry, dangerous man.
1315: 
1316: "It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly."
1317: Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
1318: ascending the stairs.
1319: 
1320: "Is he alone?" the latter whispered.
1321: 
1322: "Alone! God help him, who should be with him!" said the other, in the
1323: same low voice.
1324: 
1325: "Is he always alone, then?"
1326: 
1327: "Yes."
1328: 
1329: "Of his own desire?"
1330: 
1331: "Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
1332: found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be
1333: discreet--as he was then, so he is now."
1334: 
1335: "He is greatly changed?"
1336: 
1337: "Changed!"
1338: 
1339: The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
1340: and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so
1341: forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
1342: two companions ascended higher and higher.
1343: 
1344: Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
1345: parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
1346: indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
1347: within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
1348: the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
1349: staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
1350: flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and
1351: hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
1352: the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
1353: intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
1354: insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
1355: and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
1356: his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
1357: Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made
1358: at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
1359: uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
1360: to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
1361: caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
1362: or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
1363: promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
1364: 
1365: At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
1366: third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
1367: and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
1368: was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
1369: advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he
1370: dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
1371: here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
1372: his shoulder, took out a key.
1373: 
1374: "The door is locked then, my friend?" said Mr. Lorry, surprised.
1375: 
1376: "Ay. Yes," was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.
1377: 
1378: "You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?"
1379: 
1380: "I think it necessary to turn the key." Monsieur Defarge whispered it
1381: closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
1382: 
1383: "Why?"
1384: 
1385: "Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
1386: frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
1387: harm--if his door was left open."
1388: 
1389: "Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. Lorry.
1390: 
1391: "Is it possible!" repeated Defarge, bitterly. "Yes. And a beautiful
1392: world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
1393: are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
1394: that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on."
1395: 
1396: This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
1397: of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she trembled
1398: under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
1399: and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
1400: on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.
1401: 
1402: "Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a
1403: moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
1404: all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you
1405: bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
1406: That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!"
1407: 
1408: They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were
1409: soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
1410: once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
1411: the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
1412: the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing
1413: footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
1414: themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
1415: wine-shop.
1416: 
1417: "I forgot them in the surprise of your visit," explained Monsieur
1418: Defarge. "Leave us, good boys; we have business here."
1419: 
1420: The three glided by, and went silently down.
1421: 
1422: There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
1423: the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
1424: Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:
1425: 
1426: "Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?"
1427: 
1428: "I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few."
1429: 
1430: "Is that well?"
1431: 
1432: "_I_ think it is well."
1433: 
1434: "Who are the few? How do you choose them?"
1435: 
1436: "I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
1437: sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another
1438: thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment."
1439: 
1440: With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in
1441: through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck
1442: twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
1443: make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,
1444: three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
1445: it as heavily as he could.
1446: 
1447: The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the
1448: room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more
1449: than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.
1450: 
1451: He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry
1452: got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he
1453: felt that she was sinking.
1454: 
1455: "A-a-a-business, business!" he urged, with a moisture that was not of
1456: business shining on his cheek. "Come in, come in!"
1457: 
1458: "I am afraid of it," she answered, shuddering.
1459: 
1460: "Of it? What?"
1461: 
1462: "I mean of him. Of my father."
1463: 
1464: Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of
1465: their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
1466: shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
1467: down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.
1468: 
1469: Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
1470: took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,
1471: methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
1472: could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to
1473: where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.
1474: 
1475: The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
1476: and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
1477: roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
1478: the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
1479: other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this
1480: door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
1481: Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
1482: was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
1483: alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
1484: requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
1485: done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
1486: towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
1487: him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
1488: busy, making shoes.
1489: 
1490: 
1491: 
1492: 
1493: VI. The Shoemaker
1494: 
1495: 
1496: "Good day!" said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
1497: bent low over the shoemaking.
1498: 
1499: It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
1500: salutation, as if it were at a distance:
1501: 
1502: "Good day!"
1503: 
1504: "You are still hard at work, I see?"
1505: 
1506: After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
1507: voice replied, "Yes--I am working." This time, a pair of haggard eyes
1508: had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
1509: 
1510: The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
1511: faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
1512: doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
1513: the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo
1514: of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
1515: resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
1516: beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
1517: suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive
1518: it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
1519: wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
1520: home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
1521: 
1522: Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
1523: up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
1524: perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
1525: aware of had stood, was not yet empty.
1526: 
1527: "I want," said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,
1528: "to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?"
1529: 
1530: The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
1531: at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
1532: other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
1533: 
1534: "What did you say?"
1535: 
1536: "You can bear a little more light?"
1537: 
1538: "I must bear it, if you let it in." (Laying the palest shadow of a
1539: stress upon the second word.)
1540: 
1541: The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
1542: angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
1543: showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his
1544: labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
1545: feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
1546: long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and
1547: thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet
1548: dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
1549: otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
1550: His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body
1551: to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose
1552: stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
1553: from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
1554: parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.
1555: 
1556: He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones
1557: of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
1558: pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
1559: first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had
1560: lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without
1561: first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
1562: 
1563: "Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?" asked Defarge,
1564: motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.
1565: 
1566: "What did you say?"
1567: 
1568: "Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?"
1569: 
1570: "I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know."
1571: 
1572: But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.
1573: 
1574: Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
1575: he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
1576: looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
1577: unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
1578: it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
1579: the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The
1580: look and the action had occupied but an instant.
1581: 
1582: "You have a visitor, you see," said Monsieur Defarge.
1583: 
1584: "What did you say?"
1585: 
1586: "Here is a visitor."
1587: 
1588: The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
1589: work.
1590: 
1591: "Come!" said Defarge. "Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
1592: he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur."
1593: 
1594: Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.
1595: 
1596: "Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name."
1597: 
1598: There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:
1599: 
1600: "I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?"
1601: 
1602: "I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's
1603: information?"
1604: 
1605: "It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the
1606: present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand." He
1607: glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
1608: 
1609: "And the maker's name?" said Defarge.
1610: 
1611: Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand
1612: in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
1613: hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and
1614: so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of
1615: recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
1616: had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
1617: endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
1618: fast-dying man.
1619: 
1620: "Did you ask me for my name?"
1621: 
1622: "Assuredly I did."
1623: 
1624: "One Hundred and Five, North Tower."
1625: 
1626: "Is that all?"
1627: 
1628: "One Hundred and Five, North Tower."
1629: 
1630: With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work
1631: again, until the silence was again broken.
1632: 
1633: "You are not a shoemaker by trade?" said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
1634: at him.
1635: 
1636: His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the
1637: question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
1638: on the questioner when they had sought the ground.
1639: 
1640: "I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I
1641: learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--"
1642: 
1643: He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his
1644: hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
1645: from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and
1646: resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
1647: subject of last night.
1648: 
1649: "I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
1650: a long while, and I have made shoes ever since."
1651: 
1652: As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.
1653: Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:
1654: 
1655: "Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?"
1656: 
1657: The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
1658: questioner.
1659: 
1660: "Monsieur Manette"; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; "do you
1661: remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old
1662: banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
1663: mind, Monsieur Manette?"
1664: 
1665: As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
1666: Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
1667: intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
1668: through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
1669: again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
1670: so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
1671: had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where
1672: she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
1673: raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
1674: shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
1675: trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
1676: breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
1677: repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
1678: looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
1679: 
1680: Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and
1681: less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
1682: and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he
1683: took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
1684: 
1685: "Have you recognised him, monsieur?" asked Defarge in a whisper.
1686: 
1687: "Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
1688: unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
1689: well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!"
1690: 
1691: She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
1692: which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
1693: figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
1694: over his labour.
1695: 
1696: Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,
1697: beside him, and he bent over his work.
1698: 
1699: It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
1700: in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him
1701: which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
1702: stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
1703: raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,
1704: but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
1705: striking at her with the knife, though they had.
1706: 
1707: He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
1708: to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in
1709: the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:
1710: 
1711: "What is this?"
1712: 
1713: With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her
1714: lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she
1715: laid his ruined head there.
1716: 
1717: "You are not the gaoler's daughter?"
1718: 
1719: She sighed "No."
1720: 
1721: "Who are you?"
1722: 
1723: Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
1724: beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
1725: thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
1726: laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.
1727: 
1728: Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
1729: aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and
1730: little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action
1731: he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his
1732: shoemaking.
1733: 
1734: But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
1735: shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
1736: be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand
1737: to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
1738: attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained
1739: a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
1740: hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.
1741: 
1742: He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. "It is
1743: the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!"
1744: 
1745: As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
1746: become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
1747: light, and looked at her.
1748: 
1749: "She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
1750: out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
1751: brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. 'You will
1752: leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
1753: may in the spirit.' Those were the words I said. I remember them very
1754: well."
1755: 
1756: He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.
1757: But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,
1758: though slowly.
1759: 
1760: "How was this?--_Was it you_?"
1761: 
1762: Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a
1763: frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
1764: said, in a low voice, "I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
1765: us, do not speak, do not move!"
1766: 
1767: "Hark!" he exclaimed. "Whose voice was that?"
1768: 
1769: His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white
1770: hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his
1771: shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
1772: tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and
1773: gloomily shook his head.
1774: 
1775: "No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what the
1776: prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
1777: she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He
1778: was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your
1779: name, my gentle angel?"
1780: 
1781: Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees
1782: before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.
1783: 
1784: "O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
1785: and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
1786: cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
1787: tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
1788: me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!"
1789: 
1790: His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and
1791: lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.
1792: 
1793: "If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it
1794: is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
1795: sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in
1796: touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
1797: breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when
1798: I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
1799: with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
1800: remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
1801: weep for it, weep for it!"
1802: 
1803: She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a
1804: child.
1805: 
1806: "If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
1807: have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
1808: peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
1809: and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
1810: if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
1811: and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
1812: honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
1813: striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
1814: my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep
1815: for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred
1816: tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
1817: God for us, thank God!"
1818: 
1819: He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so
1820: touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
1821: had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
1822: 
1823: When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving
1824: breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
1825: storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
1826: called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
1827: daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
1828: there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his
1829: head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained
1830: him from the light.
1831: 
1832: "If, without disturbing him," she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as
1833: he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, "all could be
1834: arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he
1835: could be taken away--"
1836: 
1837: "But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?" asked Mr. Lorry.
1838: 
1839: "More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
1840: him."
1841: 
1842: "It is true," said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. "More
1843: than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
1844: Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?"
1845: 
1846: "That's business," said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
1847: methodical manners; "and if business is to be done, I had better do it."
1848: 
1849: "Then be so kind," urged Miss Manette, "as to leave us here. You see how
1850: composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
1851: now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from
1852: interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,
1853: as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until
1854: you return, and then we will remove him straight."
1855: 
1856: Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
1857: in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage
1858: and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
1859: for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
1860: dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
1861: to do it.
1862: 
1863: Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
1864: hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The darkness
1865: deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
1866: through the chinks in the wall.
1867: 
1868: Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
1869: had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
1870: meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
1871: lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the
1872: garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
1873: assisted him to his feet.
1874: 
1875: No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in
1876: the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,
1877: whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that
1878: he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They
1879: tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to
1880: answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for
1881: the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of
1882: occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen
1883: in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
1884: daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
1885: 
1886: In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
1887: ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
1888: and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to
1889: his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
1890: in both his own.
1891: 
1892: They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
1893: Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps
1894: of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
1895: round at the walls.
1896: 
1897: "You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?"
1898: 
1899: "What did you say?"
1900: 
1901: But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if
1902: she had repeated it.
1903: 
1904: "Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago."
1905: 
1906: That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
1907: prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,
1908: "One Hundred and Five, North Tower;" and when he looked about him, it
1909: evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
1910: him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
1911: tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
1912: no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
1913: dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.
1914: 
1915: No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
1916: many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural
1917: silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and
1918: that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
1919: saw nothing.
1920: 
1921: The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
1922: him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
1923: miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame
1924: Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
1925: went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
1926: brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
1927: against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
1928: 
1929: Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word "To the Barrier!" The
1930: postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
1931: over-swinging lamps.
1932: 
1933: Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
1934: streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
1935: illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
1936: gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. "Your papers,
1937: travellers!" "See here then, Monsieur the Officer," said Defarge,
1938: getting down, and taking him gravely apart, "these are the papers of
1939: monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with
1940: him, at the--" He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the
1941: military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
1942: in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
1943: or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. "It is well.
1944: Forward!" from the uniform. "Adieu!" from Defarge. And so, under a short
1945: grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
1946: grove of stars.
1947: 
1948: Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
1949: this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
1950: rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
1951: is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
1952: All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
1953: whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
1954: man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
1955: lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:
1956: 
1957: "I hope you care to be recalled to life?"
1958: 
1959: And the old answer:
1960: 
1961: "I can't say."
1962: 
1963: 
1964: The end of the first book.
1965: 
1966:

1975: I. Five Years Later
1976: 
1977: 
1978: Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
1979: year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
1980: dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
1981: moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
1982: proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
1983: proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence
1984: in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
1985: it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was
1986: no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
1987: convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted
1988: no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no
1989: embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but
1990: Tellson's, thank Heaven--!
1991: 
1992: Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
1993: question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much
1994: on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
1995: suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
1996: objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
1997: 
1998: Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection
1999: of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
2000: a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,
2001: and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
2002: counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
2003: wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
2004: windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
2005: and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
2006: heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
2007: "the House," you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
2008: where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
2009: hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
2010: twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
2011: drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
2012: they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
2013: were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among
2014: the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
2015: polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
2016: made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
2017: parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family
2018: papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
2019: dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
2020: one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
2021: by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
2022: from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
2023: exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
2024: Abyssinia or Ashantee.
2025: 
2026: But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
2027: with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.
2028: Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?
2029: Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
2030: was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
2031: purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
2032: of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to
2033: Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
2034: three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
2035: Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
2036: might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
2037: reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
2038: particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
2039: after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business,
2040: its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
2041: low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
2042: disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
2043: ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.
2044: 
2045: Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the
2046: oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young
2047: man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was
2048: old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full
2049: Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to
2050: be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches
2051: and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
2052: 
2053: Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
2054: odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
2055: sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless
2056: upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
2057: of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson's,
2058: in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always
2059: tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
2060: this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
2061: occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
2062: easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
2063: appellation of Jerry.
2064: 
2065: The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
2066: Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
2067: morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself
2068: always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
2069: the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
2070: popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)
2071: 
2072: Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
2073: but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
2074: might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as
2075: it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was
2076: already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
2077: for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
2078: was spread.
2079: 
2080: Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
2081: at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
2082: and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair
2083: looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he
2084: exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:
2085: 
2086: "Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!"
2087: 
2088: A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
2089: corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
2090: person referred to.
2091: 
2092: "What!" said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. "You're at it
2093: agin, are you?"
2094: 
2095: After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at
2096: the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
2097: odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that,
2098: whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he
2099: often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
2100: 
2101: "What," said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
2102: mark--"what are you up to, Aggerawayter?"
2103: 
2104: "I was only saying my prayers."
2105: 
2106: "Saying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping
2107: yourself down and praying agin me?"
2108: 
2109: "I was not praying against you; I was praying for you."
2110: 
2111: "You weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. Here!
2112: your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
2113: father's prosperity. You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
2114: You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
2115: herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
2116: of the mouth of her only child."
2117: 
2118: Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning
2119: to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
2120: board.
2121: 
2122: "And what do you suppose, you conceited female," said Mr. Cruncher, with
2123: unconscious inconsistency, "that the worth of _your_ prayers may be?
2124: Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!"
2125: 
2126: "They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than
2127: that."
2128: 
2129: "Worth no more than that," repeated Mr. Cruncher. "They ain't worth
2130: much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. I can't
2131: afford it. I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If
2132: you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
2133: child, and not in opposition to 'em. If I had had any but a unnat'ral
2134: wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might
2135: have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
2136: countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
2137: B-u-u-ust me!" said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
2138: on his clothes, "if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and
2139: another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
2140: devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
2141: boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
2142: then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I
2143: tell you," here he addressed his wife once more, "I won't be gone agin,
2144: in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as
2145: laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if
2146: it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
2147: I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've
2148: been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
2149: it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
2150: say now!"
2151: 
2152: Growling, in addition, such phrases as "Ah! yes! You're religious, too.
2153: You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
2154: and child, would you? Not you!" and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
2155: from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
2156: himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.
2157: In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
2158: and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did,
2159: kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor
2160: woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made
2161: his toilet, with a suppressed cry of "You are going to flop, mother.
2162: --Halloa, father!" and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
2163: again with an undutiful grin.
2164: 
2165: Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his
2166: breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular
2167: animosity.
2168: 
2169: "Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?"
2170: 
2171: His wife explained that she had merely "asked a blessing."
2172: 
2173: "Don't do it!" said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
2174: to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions. "I
2175: ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my wittles
2176: blest off my table. Keep still!"
2177: 
2178: Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
2179: which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
2180: his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
2181: inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled
2182: aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
2183: he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
2184: of the day.
2185: 
2186: It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
2187: description of himself as "a honest tradesman." His stock consisted of
2188: a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
2189: young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to
2190: beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
2191: with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
2192: from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's
2193: feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.
2194: Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
2195: itself,--and was almost as in-looking.
2196: 
2197: Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his
2198: three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's,
2199: Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
2200: standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
2201: inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
2202: boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
2203: extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
2204: in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
2205: eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
2206: The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
2207: the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
2208: youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
2209: in Fleet-street.
2210: 
2211: The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's
2212: establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:
2213: 
2214: "Porter wanted!"
2215: 
2216: "Hooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with!"
2217: 
2218: Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
2219: the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
2220: had been chewing, and cogitated.
2221: 
2222: "Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!" muttered young Jerry.
2223: "Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don't get no iron
2224: rust here!"
2225: 
2226: 
2227: 
2228: 
2229: II. A Sight
2230: 
2231: 
2232: "You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?" said one of the oldest of
2233: clerks to Jerry the messenger.
2234: 
2235: "Ye-es, sir," returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. "I _do_
2236: know the Bailey."
2237: 
2238: "Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry."
2239: 
2240: "I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
2241: better," said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
2242: in question, "than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey."
2243: 
2244: "Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
2245: door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in."
2246: 
2247: "Into the court, sir?"
2248: 
2249: "Into the court."
2250: 
2251: Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
2252: interchange the inquiry, "What do you think of this?"
2253: 
2254: "Am I to wait in the court, sir?" he asked, as the result of that
2255: conference.
2256: 
2257: "I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
2258: Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's
2259: attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,
2260: to remain there until he wants you."
2261: 
2262: "Is that all, sir?"
2263: 
2264: "That's all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him
2265: you are there."
2266: 
2267: As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
2268: Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
2269: blotting-paper stage, remarked:
2270: 
2271: "I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?"
2272: 
2273: "Treason!"
2274: 
2275: "That's quartering," said Jerry. "Barbarous!"
2276: 
2277: "It is the law," remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
2278: spectacles upon him. "It is the law."
2279: 
2280: "It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It's hard enough to kill
2281: him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir."
2282: 
2283: "Not at all," retained the ancient clerk. "Speak well of the law. Take
2284: care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
2285: care of itself. I give you that advice."
2286: 
2287: "It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice," said Jerry. "I
2288: leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is."
2289: 
2290: "Well, well," said the old clerk; "we all have our various ways of
2291: gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
2292: ways. Here is the letter. Go along."
2293: 
2294: Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
2295: deference than he made an outward show of, "You are a lean old one,
2296: too," made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,
2297: and went his way.
2298: 
2299: They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
2300: not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
2301: But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
2302: villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
2303: into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
2304: dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It
2305: had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
2306: his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him.
2307: For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
2308: from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
2309: a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
2310: half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
2311: So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It
2312: was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
2313: a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
2314: the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
2315: softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
2316: blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
2317: leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
2318: under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
2319: illustration of the precept, that "Whatever is is right;" an aphorism
2320: that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
2321: consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
2322: 
2323: Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
2324: hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
2325: way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in
2326: his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play
2327: at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
2328: former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey
2329: doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
2330: criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
2331: 
2332: After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
2333: very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
2334: court.
2335: 
2336: "What's on?" he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
2337: to.
2338: 
2339: "Nothing yet."
2340: 
2341: "What's coming on?"
2342: 
2343: "The Treason case."
2344: 
2345: "The quartering one, eh?"
2346: 
2347: "Ah!" returned the man, with a relish; "he'll be drawn on a hurdle to
2348: be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own
2349: face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
2350: and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters.
2351: That's the sentence."
2352: 
2353: "If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?" Jerry added, by way of proviso.
2354: 
2355: "Oh! they'll find him guilty," said the other. "Don't you be afraid of
2356: that."
2357: 
2358: Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he
2359: saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry
2360: sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
2361: gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
2362: before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
2363: in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him
2364: then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
2365: court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
2366: with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
2367: to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
2368: 
2369: "What's _he_ got to do with the case?" asked the man he had spoken with.
2370: 
2371: "Blest if I know," said Jerry.
2372: 
2373: "What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?"
2374: 
2375: "Blest if I know that either," said Jerry.
2376: 
2377: The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
2378: down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the
2379: central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
2380: went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
2381: 
2382: Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
2383: ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled
2384: at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round
2385: pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows
2386: stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
2387: laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
2388: themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got
2389: upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
2390: Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
2391: of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
2392: whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with
2393: the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
2394: that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him
2395: in an impure mist and rain.
2396: 
2397: The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
2398: five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
2399: a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly
2400: dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
2401: dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
2402: of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express
2403: itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
2404: situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
2405: soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
2406: bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.
2407: 
2408: The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
2409: was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less
2410: horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
2411: details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
2412: fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
2413: was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
2414: and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various
2415: spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
2416: powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.
2417: 
2418: Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
2419: an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
2420: he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
2421: forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
2422: occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
2423: King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
2424: so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
2425: our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
2426: said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
2427: evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
2428: said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
2429: to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
2430: becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
2431: huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
2432: the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
2433: there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
2434: that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.
2435: 
2436: The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
2437: beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
2438: the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and
2439: attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
2440: and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
2441: composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
2442: it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
2443: vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
2444: 
2445: Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
2446: upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
2447: it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. Haunted
2448: in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
2449: glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
2450: day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
2451: for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. Be
2452: that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
2453: of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
2454: face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.
2455: 
2456: It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
2457: which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,
2458: in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look
2459: immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his
2460: aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.
2461: 
2462: The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
2463: twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
2464: remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
2465: and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
2466: but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he
2467: looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
2468: it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
2469: handsome man, not past the prime of life.
2470: 
2471: His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by
2472: him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her
2473: dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had
2474: been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
2475: that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
2476: noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
2477: had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,
2478: "Who are they?"
2479: 
2480: Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own
2481: manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
2482: absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
2483: him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
2484: from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
2485: to Jerry:
2486: 
2487: "Witnesses."
2488: 
2489: "For which side?"
2490: 
2491: "Against."
2492: 
2493: "Against what side?"
2494: 
2495: "The prisoner's."
2496: 
2497: The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
2498: leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
2499: in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
2500: axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
2501: 
2502: 
2503: 
2504: 
2505: III. A Disappointment
2506: 
2507: 
2508: Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
2509: them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
2510: claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the
2511: public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
2512: even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the
2513: prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
2514: repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
2515: he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of
2516: traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real
2517: wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.
2518: That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
2519: was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
2520: prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his
2521: Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
2522: That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and
2523: attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner's
2524: friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
2525: infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
2526: in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues
2527: were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
2528: benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as
2529: they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,
2530: as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well
2531: knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
2532: whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
2533: they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more
2534: especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
2535: That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
2536: for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
2537: communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him
2538: a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets,
2539: and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to
2540: hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
2541: in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General's)
2542: brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.
2543: Attorney-General's) father and mother. That, he called with confidence
2544: on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two
2545: witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
2546: produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
2547: his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
2548: sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
2549: such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be
2550: proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the
2551: same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
2552: showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof
2553: would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
2554: in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
2555: very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
2556: That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they
2557: were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must
2558: positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether
2559: they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their
2560: pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
2561: their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
2562: of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
2563: there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
2564: pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off. That head
2565: Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
2566: everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
2567: of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
2568: good as dead and gone.
2569: 
2570: When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
2571: a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
2572: anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
2573: unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
2574: 
2575: Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the
2576: patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was
2577: exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
2578: it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
2579: of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
2580: wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
2581: Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
2582: opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
2583: 
2584: Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.
2585: What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn't
2586: precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody's.
2587: Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very
2588: distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors'
2589: prison? Didn't see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors'
2590: prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three
2591: times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever
2592: been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?
2593: Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
2594: downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
2595: dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
2596: committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?
2597: Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not
2598: more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.
2599: Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
2600: very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
2601: No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more
2602: about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.
2603: Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government
2604: pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear
2605: no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer
2606: patriotism? None whatever.
2607: 
2608: The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
2609: great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
2610: simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
2611: packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
2612: He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
2613: charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of
2614: the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging
2615: his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
2616: prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from
2617: the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He had not put them there first. He
2618: had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
2619: at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
2620: Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given
2621: information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
2622: he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
2623: only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
2624: that was merely a coincidence. He didn't call it a particularly curious
2625: coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
2626: curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He
2627: was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
2628: 
2629: The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
2630: Lorry.
2631: 
2632: "Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?"
2633: 
2634: "I am."
2635: 
2636: "On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and
2637: seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and
2638: Dover by the mail?"
2639: 
2640: "It did."
2641: 
2642: "Were there any other passengers in the mail?"
2643: 
2644: "Two."
2645: 
2646: "Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?"
2647: 
2648: "They did."
2649: 
2650: "Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?"
2651: 
2652: "I cannot undertake to say that he was."
2653: 
2654: "Does he resemble either of these two passengers?"
2655: 
2656: "Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so
2657: reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that."
2658: 
2659: "Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as
2660: those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to
2661: render it unlikely that he was one of them?"
2662: 
2663: "No."
2664: 
2665: "You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?"
2666: 
2667: "No."
2668: 
2669: "So at least you say he may have been one of them?"
2670: 
2671: "Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like
2672: myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous
2673: air."
2674: 
2675: "Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?"
2676: 
2677: "I certainly have seen that."
2678: 
2679: "Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your
2680: certain knowledge, before?"
2681: 
2682: "I have."
2683: 
2684: "When?"
2685: 
2686: "I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the
2687: prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the
2688: voyage with me."
2689: 
2690: "At what hour did he come on board?"
2691: 
2692: "At a little after midnight."
2693: 
2694: "In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board
2695: at that untimely hour?"
2696: 
2697: "He happened to be the only one."
2698: 
2699: "Never mind about 'happening,' Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who
2700: came on board in the dead of the night?"
2701: 
2702: "He was."
2703: 
2704: "Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?"
2705: 
2706: "With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here."
2707: 
2708: "They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?"
2709: 
2710: "Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
2711: I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore."
2712: 
2713: "Miss Manette!"
2714: 
2715: The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
2716: turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and
2717: kept her hand drawn through his arm.
2718: 
2719: "Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner."
2720: 
2721: To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
2722: far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
2723: Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all
2724: the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him
2725: to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
2726: before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts
2727: to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
2728: rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.
2729: 
2730: "Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?"
2731: 
2732: "Yes, sir."
2733: 
2734: "Where?"
2735: 
2736: "On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
2737: occasion."
2738: 
2739: "You are the young lady just now referred to?"
2740: 
2741: "O! most unhappily, I am!"
2742: 
2743: The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
2744: of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: "Answer the questions put
2745: to you, and make no remark upon them."
2746: 
2747: "Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
2748: passage across the Channel?"
2749: 
2750: "Yes, sir."
2751: 
2752: "Recall it."
2753: 
2754: In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: "When the
2755: gentleman came on board--"
2756: 
2757: "Do you mean the prisoner?" inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.
2758: 
2759: "Yes, my Lord."
2760: 
2761: "Then say the prisoner."
2762: 
2763: "When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father," turning
2764: her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, "was much fatigued
2765: and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
2766: afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
2767: deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
2768: care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
2769: The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
2770: shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I
2771: had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
2772: set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed
2773: great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he
2774: felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together."
2775: 
2776: "Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?"
2777: 
2778: "No."
2779: 
2780: "How many were with him?"
2781: 
2782: "Two French gentlemen."
2783: 
2784: "Had they conferred together?"
2785: 
2786: "They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
2787: necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat."
2788: 
2789: "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?"
2790: 
2791: "Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what
2792: papers."
2793: 
2794: "Like these in shape and size?"
2795: 
2796: "Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very
2797: near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
2798: light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
2799: spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
2800: they looked at papers."
2801: 
2802: "Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette."
2803: 
2804: "The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out
2805: of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my
2806: father. I hope," bursting into tears, "I may not repay him by doing him
2807: harm to-day."
2808: 
2809: Buzzing from the blue-flies.
2810: 
2811: "Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
2812: you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
2813: give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
2814: he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on."
2815: 
2816: "He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
2817: difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
2818: therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
2819: had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
2820: take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
2821: time to come."
2822: 
2823: "Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular."
2824: 
2825: "He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said
2826: that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
2827: England's part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
2828: Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
2829: Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
2830: laughingly, and to beguile the time."
2831: 
2832: Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
2833: a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
2834: unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
2835: anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
2836: she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
2837: the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
2838: expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
2839: of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
2840: when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
2841: heresy about George Washington.
2842: 
2843: Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
2844: necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's
2845: father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.
2846: 
2847: "Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?"
2848: 
2849: "Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or
2850: three years and a half ago."
2851: 
2852: "Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
2853: speak to his conversation with your daughter?"
2854: 
2855: "Sir, I can do neither."
2856: 
2857: "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
2858: either?"
2859: 
2860: He answered, in a low voice, "There is."
2861: 
2862: "Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
2863: trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?"
2864: 
2865: He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, "A long imprisonment."
2866: 
2867: "Were you newly released on the occasion in question?"
2868: 
2869: "They tell me so."
2870: 
2871: "Have you no remembrance of the occasion?"
2872: 
2873: "None. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
2874: time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
2875: time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
2876: here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
2877: my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
2878: familiar. I have no remembrance of the process."
2879: 
2880: Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
2881: together.
2882: 
2883: A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being
2884: to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
2885: in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
2886: got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did
2887: not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,
2888: to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
2889: was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,
2890: in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
2891: waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining
2892: this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner
2893: on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
2894: been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
2895: little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening
2896: this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
2897: attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
2898: 
2899: "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?"
2900: 
2901: The witness was quite sure.
2902: 
2903: "Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?"
2904: 
2905: Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.
2906: 
2907: "Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there," pointing
2908: to him who had tossed the paper over, "and then look well upon the
2909: prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?"
2910: 
2911: Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly
2912: if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
2913: not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
2914: into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
2915: his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
2916: much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's
2917: counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned
2918: friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
2919: would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
2920: happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
2921: this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
2922: confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash
2923: this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
2924: useless lumber.
2925: 
2926: Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
2927: fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.
2928: Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit
2929: of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
2930: traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
2931: scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look
2932: rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,
2933: and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
2934: swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
2935: affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making
2936: those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
2937: consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,
2938: even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped
2939: and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
2940: had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
2941: gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
2942: and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
2943: reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
2944: impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
2945: How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
2946: attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
2947: and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
2948: how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
2949: character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
2950: State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed
2951: (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
2952: not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.
2953: 
2954: Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
2955: attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
2956: Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
2957: Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
2958: prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
2959: the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
2960: decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
2961: 
2962: And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.
2963: 
2964: Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
2965: changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
2966: While his teamed friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,
2967: whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
2968: anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
2969: grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,
2970: and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
2971: in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
2972: sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
2973: on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his
2974: hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
2975: day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him
2976: a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
2977: undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,
2978: when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the
2979: lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would
2980: hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the
2981: observation to his next neighbour, and added, "I'd hold half a guinea
2982: that _he_ don't get no law-work to do. Don't look like the sort of one
2983: to get any, do he?"
2984: 
2985: Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
2986: appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon
2987: her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
2988: "Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.
2989: Don't you see she will fall!"
2990: 
2991: There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much
2992: sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to
2993: him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
2994: strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or
2995: brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
2996: ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
2997: moment, spoke, through their foreman.
2998: 
2999: They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George
3000: Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
3001: but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
3002: and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
3003: the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the
3004: jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get
3005: refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
3006: down.
3007: 
3008: Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,
3009: now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
3010: could easily get near him.
3011: 
3012: "Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the
3013: way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don't be a moment
3014: behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You
3015: are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
3016: before I can."
3017: 
3018: Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
3019: acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up
3020: at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.
3021: 
3022: "How is the young lady?"
3023: 
3024: "She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
3025: feels the better for being out of court."
3026: 
3027: "I'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman
3028: like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know."
3029: 
3030: Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
3031: in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
3032: The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
3033: eyes, ears, and spikes.
3034: 
3035: "Mr. Darnay!"
3036: 
3037: The prisoner came forward directly.
3038: 
3039: "You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She
3040: will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation."
3041: 
3042: "I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so
3043: for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?"
3044: 
3045: "Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it."
3046: 
3047: Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,
3048: half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.
3049: 
3050: "I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks."
3051: 
3052: "What," said Carton, still only half turned towards him, "do you expect,
3053: Mr. Darnay?"
3054: 
3055: "The worst."
3056: 
3057: "It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
3058: withdrawing is in your favour."
3059: 
3060: Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
3061: more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
3062: in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
3063: them.
3064: 
3065: An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
3066: passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
3067: The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
3068: refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
3069: of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along
3070: with them.
3071: 
3072: "Jerry! Jerry!" Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got
3073: there.
3074: 
3075: "Here, sir! It's a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!"
3076: 
3077: Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. "Quick! Have you got
3078: it?"
3079: 
3080: "Yes, sir."
3081: 
3082: Hastily written on the paper was the word "ACQUITTED."
3083: 
3084: "If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again," muttered
3085: Jerry, as he turned, "I should have known what you meant, this time."
3086: 
3087: He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
3088: until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
3089: with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
3090: swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
3091: search of other carrion.
3092: 
3093: 
3094: 
3095: 
3096: IV. Congratulatory
3097: 
3098: 
3099: From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
3100: human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
3101: Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
3102: for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
3103: Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
3104: death.
3105: 
3106: It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
3107: in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
3108: shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him
3109: twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
3110: had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
3111: to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
3112: reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long
3113: lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
3114: from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
3115: itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those
3116: unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
3117: Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three
3118: hundred miles away.
3119: 
3120: Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
3121: his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
3122: misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
3123: the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
3124: influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could
3125: recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
3126: and slight, and she believed them over.
3127: 
3128: Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
3129: to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little
3130: more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
3131: loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
3132: way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
3133: conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
3134: 
3135: He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
3136: late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
3137: out of the group: "I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
3138: Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
3139: less likely to succeed on that account."
3140: 
3141: "You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,"
3142: said his late client, taking his hand.
3143: 
3144: "I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
3145: another man's, I believe."
3146: 
3147: It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, "Much better," Mr. Lorry
3148: said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
3149: object of squeezing himself back again.
3150: 
3151: "You think so?" said Mr. Stryver. "Well! you have been present all day,
3152: and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too."
3153: 
3154: "And as such," quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
3155: now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
3156: him out of it--"as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
3157: this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
3158: Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out."
3159: 
3160: "Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver; "I have a night's work to
3161: do yet. Speak for yourself."
3162: 
3163: "I speak for myself," answered Mr. Lorry, "and for Mr. Darnay, and for
3164: Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?"
3165: He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.
3166: 
3167: His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
3168: Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
3169: not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
3170: thoughts had wandered away.
3171: 
3172: "My father," said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.
3173: 
3174: He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.
3175: 
3176: "Shall we go home, my father?"
3177: 
3178: With a long breath, he answered "Yes."
3179: 
3180: The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
3181: impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
3182: released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
3183: passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
3184: and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of
3185: gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
3186: Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
3187: the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
3188: departed in it.
3189: 
3190: Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
3191: to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or
3192: interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
3193: against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
3194: out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now
3195: stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.
3196: 
3197: "So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?"
3198: 
3199: Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's
3200: proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the
3201: better for it in appearance.
3202: 
3203: "If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
3204: business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
3205: appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay."
3206: 
3207: Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, "You have mentioned that before,
3208: sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We
3209: have to think of the House more than ourselves."
3210: 
3211: "_I_ know, _I_ know," rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. "Don't be
3212: nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
3213: I dare say."
3214: 
3215: "And indeed, sir," pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, "I really don't
3216: know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as very
3217: much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your
3218: business."
3219: 
3220: "Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business," said Mr. Carton.
3221: 
3222: "It is a pity you have not, sir."
3223: 
3224: "I think so, too."
3225: 
3226: "If you had," pursued Mr. Lorry, "perhaps you would attend to it."
3227: 
3228: "Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't," said Mr. Carton.
3229: 
3230: "Well, sir!" cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
3231: "business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
3232: if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
3233: Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
3234: for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!
3235: I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
3236: life.--Chair there!"
3237: 
3238: Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
3239: Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton,
3240: who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
3241: then, and turned to Darnay:
3242: 
3243: "This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
3244: be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
3245: these street stones?"
3246: 
3247: "I hardly seem yet," returned Charles Darnay, "to belong to this world
3248: again."
3249: 
3250: "I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far
3251: advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly."
3252: 
3253: "I begin to think I _am_ faint."
3254: 
3255: "Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those
3256: numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
3257: some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at."
3258: 
3259: Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to
3260: Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
3261: shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
3262: his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
3263: opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
3264: before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.
3265: 
3266: "Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
3267: Darnay?"
3268: 
3269: "I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
3270: mended as to feel that."
3271: 
3272: "It must be an immense satisfaction!"
3273: 
3274: He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
3275: one.
3276: 
3277: "As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
3278: It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we
3279: are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are
3280: not much alike in any particular, you and I."
3281: 
3282: Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
3283: this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
3284: at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
3285: 
3286: "Now your dinner is done," Carton presently said, "why don't you call a
3287: health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?"
3288: 
3289: "What health? What toast?"
3290: 
3291: "Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll
3292: swear it's there."
3293: 
3294: "Miss Manette, then!"
3295: 
3296: "Miss Manette, then!"
3297: 
3298: Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
3299: flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
3300: pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
3301: 
3302: "That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!"
3303: he said, filling his new goblet.
3304: 
3305: A slight frown and a laconic "Yes," were the answer.
3306: 
3307: "That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it
3308: feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such
3309: sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?"
3310: 
3311: Again Darnay answered not a word.
3312: 
3313: "She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not
3314: that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was."
3315: 
3316: The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
3317: disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the
3318: strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him
3319: for it.
3320: 
3321: "I neither want any thanks, nor merit any," was the careless rejoinder.
3322: "It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did
3323: it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question."
3324: 
3325: "Willingly, and a small return for your good offices."
3326: 
3327: "Do you think I particularly like you?"
3328: 
3329: "Really, Mr. Carton," returned the other, oddly disconcerted, "I have
3330: not asked myself the question."
3331: 
3332: "But ask yourself the question now."
3333: 
3334: "You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do."
3335: 
3336: "_I_ don't think I do," said Carton. "I begin to have a very good
3337: opinion of your understanding."
3338: 
3339: "Nevertheless," pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, "there is
3340: nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
3341: parting without ill-blood on either side."
3342: 
3343: Carton rejoining, "Nothing in life!" Darnay rang. "Do you call the whole
3344: reckoning?" said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, "Then
3345: bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
3346: ten."
3347: 
3348: The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
3349: Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
3350: of defiance in his manner, and said, "A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
3351: I am drunk?"
3352: 
3353: "I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton."
3354: 
3355: "Think? You know I have been drinking."
3356: 
3357: "Since I must say so, I know it."
3358: 
3359: "Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I
3360: care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me."
3361: 
3362: "Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better."
3363: 
3364: "May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate you,
3365: however; you don't know what it may come to. Good night!"
3366: 
3367: When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
3368: glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.
3369: 
3370: "Do you particularly like the man?" he muttered, at his own image; "why
3371: should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing
3372: in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have
3373: made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
3374: what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change
3375: places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
3376: he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and
3377: have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow."
3378: 
3379: He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
3380: minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
3381: table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.
3382: 
3383: 
3384: 
3385: 
3386: V. The Jackal
3387: 
3388: 
3389: Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
3390: the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
3391: statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
3392: in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a
3393: perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
3394: The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
3395: learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
3396: Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
3397: practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
3398: drier parts of the legal race.
3399: 
3400: A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
3401: begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
3402: he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
3403: specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
3404: visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the
3405: florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
3406: the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
3407: among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
3408: 
3409: It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
3410: man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
3411: faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
3412: among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments.
3413: But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more
3414: business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
3415: pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
3416: Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.
3417: 
3418: Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great
3419: ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
3420: might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,
3421: anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
3422: at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
3423: they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
3424: rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
3425: to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,
3427: would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
3428: rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.
3429: 
3430: "Ten o'clock, sir," said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
3431: wake him--"ten o'clock, sir."
3432: 
3433: "_What's_ the matter?"
3434: 
3435: "Ten o'clock, sir."
3436: 
3437: "What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?"
3438: 
3439: "Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you."
3440: 
3441: "Oh! I remember. Very well, very well."
3442: 
3443: After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
3444: dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
3445: he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
3446: and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's
3447: Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
3448: 
3449: The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
3450: home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,
3451: and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He
3452: had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
3453: may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
3454: Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
3455: Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.
3456: 
3457: "You are a little late, Memory," said Stryver.
3458: 
3459: "About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later."
3460: 
3461: They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
3462: where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
3463: the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
3464: it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
3465: 
3466: "You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney."
3467: 
3468: "Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or
3469: seeing him dine--it's all one!"
3470: 
3471: "That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
3472: identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?"
3473: 
3474: "I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
3475: been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck."
3476: 
3477: Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.
3478: 
3479: "You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work."
3480: 
3481: Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
3482: room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
3483: or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
3484: out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
3485: at the table, and said, "Now I am ready!"
3486: 
3487: "Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory," said Mr. Stryver,
3488: gaily, as he looked among his papers.
3489: 
3490: "How much?"
3491: 
3492: "Only two sets of them."
3493: 
3494: "Give me the worst first."
3495: 
3496: "There they are, Sydney. Fire away!"
3497: 
3498: The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
3499: drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
3500: proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
3501: his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
3502: a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
3503: his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
3504: lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
3505: so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
3506: stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
3507: more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the
3508: matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
3509: him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
3510: jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
3511: no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
3512: gravity.
3513: 
3514: At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
3515: proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
3516: made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
3517: assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
3518: hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
3519: invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
3520: to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
3521: this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
3522: disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
3523: 
3524: "And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch," said Mr.
3525: Stryver.
3526: 
3527: The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
3528: again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
3529: 
3530: "You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
3531: to-day. Every question told."
3532: 
3533: "I always am sound; am I not?"
3534: 
3535: "I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
3536: it and smooth it again."
3537: 
3538: With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
3539: 
3541: his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, "the
3542: old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
3543: now in despondency!"
3544: 
3545: "Ah!" returned the other, sighing: "yes! The same Sydney, with the same
3546: luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own."
3547: 
3548: "And why not?"
3549: 
3550: "God knows. It was my way, I suppose."
3551: 
3552: He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
3553: him, looking at the fire.
3554: 
3555: "Carton," said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
3556: as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
3557: was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
3558: Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, "your way
3559: is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
3560: at me."
3561: 
3562: "Oh, botheration!" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
3563: good-humoured laugh, "don't _you_ be moral!"
3564: 
3565: "How have I done what I have done?" said Stryver; "how do I do what I
3566: do?"
3567: 
3568: "Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth
3569: your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
3570: do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."
3571: 
3572: "I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"
3573: 
3574: "I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were," said
3575: Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
3576: 
3577: "Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,"
3578: pursued Carton, "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
3579: mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
3580: picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
3581: didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
3582: nowhere."
3583: 
3584: "And whose fault was that?"
3585: 
3586: "Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
3587: driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
3588: that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy
3589: thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.
3590: Turn me in some other direction before I go."
3591: 
3592: "Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness," said Stryver, holding up
3593: his glass. "Are you turned in a pleasant direction?"
3594: 
3595: Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
3596: 
3597: "Pretty witness," he muttered, looking down into his glass. "I have had
3598: enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?"
3599: 
3600: "The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."
3601: 
3602: "_She_ pretty?"
3603: 
3604: "Is she not?"
3605: 
3606: "No."
3607: 
3608: "Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"
3609: 
3610: "Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
3611: of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!"
3612: 
3613: "Do you know, Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
3614: and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: "do you know, I rather
3615: thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
3616: and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"
3617: 
3618: "Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
3619: yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
3620: I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink;
3621: I'll get to bed."
3622: 
3623: When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
3624: him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
3625: windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
3626: dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
3627: lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
3628: before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
3629: the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
3630: 
3631: Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
3632: on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
3633: wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
3634: perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
3635: from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
3636: fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
3637: A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
3638: houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
3639: pillow was wet with wasted tears.
3640: 
3641: Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
3642: good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
3643: incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
3644: on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
3645: 
3646: 
3647: 
3648: 
3649: VI. Hundreds of People
3650: 
3651: 
3652: The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
3653: far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
3654: waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
3655: it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
3656: Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
3657: on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
3658: business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the
3659: quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
3660: 
3661: On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
3662: the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
3663: Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
3664: secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
3665: them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
3666: generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
3667: his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
3668: Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
3669: them.
3670: 
3671: A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
3672: found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
3673: the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
3674: had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
3675: north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
3676: grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
3677: consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
3678: instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
3679: settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
3680: the peaches ripened in their season.
3681: 
3682: The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
3683: of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
3684: though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
3685: glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
3686: place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
3687: 
3688: There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
3689: there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
3690: several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
3691: audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
3692: a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
3693: rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
3694: to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
3695: who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
3696: he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
3697: visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
3698: to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
3699: a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
3700: workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
3701: about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
3702: thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
3703: required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
3704: the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
3705: from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
3706: 
3707: Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
3708: its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
3709: His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
3710: ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
3711: he earned as much as he wanted.
3712: 
3713: These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and
3714: notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
3715: on the fine Sunday afternoon.
3716: 
3717: "Doctor Manette at home?"
3718: 
3719: Expected home.
3720: 
3721: "Miss Lucie at home?"
3722: 
3723: Expected home.
3724: 
3725: "Miss Pross at home?"
3726: 
3727: Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
3728: anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
3729: fact.
3730: 
3731: "As I am at home myself," said Mr. Lorry, "I'll go upstairs."
3732: 
3733: Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her
3734: birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
3735: make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
3736: agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
3737: by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
3738: that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
3739: rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
3740: the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
3741: delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
3742: themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
3743: stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
3744: with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
3745: time, whether he approved?
3746: 
3747: There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
3748: communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
3749: all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
3750: he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was
3751: the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books,
3752: and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
3753: the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
3754: changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
3755: Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's
3756: bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
3757: dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
3758: 
3759: "I wonder," said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, "that he keeps
3760: that reminder of his sufferings about him!"
3761: 
3762: "And why wonder at that?" was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.
3763: 
3764: It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
3765: acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
3766: had since improved.
3767: 
3768: "I should have thought--" Mr. Lorry began.
3769: 
3770: "Pooh! You'd have thought!" said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.
3771: 
3772: "How do you do?" inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
3773: express that she bore him no malice.
3774: 
3775: "I am pretty well, I thank you," answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; "how
3776: are you?"
3777: 
3778: "Nothing to boast of," said Miss Pross.
3779: 
3780: "Indeed?"
3781: 
3782: "Ah! indeed!" said Miss Pross. "I am very much put out about my
3783: Ladybird."
3784: 
3785: "Indeed?"
3786: 
3787: "For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll
3788: fidget me to death," said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
3789: stature) was shortness.
3790: 
3791: "Really, then?" said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
3792: 
3793: "Really, is bad enough," returned Miss Pross, "but better. Yes, I am
3794: very much put out."
3795: 
3796: "May I ask the cause?"
3797: 
3798: "I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
3799: come here looking after her," said Miss Pross.
3800: 
3801: "_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?"
3802: 
3803: "Hundreds," said Miss Pross.
3804: 
3805: It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
3806: time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
3807: she exaggerated it.
3808: 
3809: "Dear me!" said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.
3810: 
3811: "I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
3812: paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
3813: your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
3814: for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it's really very hard,"
3815: said Miss Pross.
3816: 
3817: Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
3818: using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
3819: fit anything.
3820: 
3821: "All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
3822: are always turning up," said Miss Pross. "When you began it--"
3823: 
3824: "_I_ began it, Miss Pross?"
3825: 
3826: "Didn't you? Who brought her father to life?"
3827: 
3828: "Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--" said Mr. Lorry.
3829: 
3830: "It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
3831: enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
3832: that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
3833: him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
3834: circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
3835: and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
3836: him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me."
3837: 
3838: Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
3839: this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
3840: unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
3841: admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
3842: it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
3843: never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
3844: their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there
3845: is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
3846: rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
3847: respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
3848: mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
3849: Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
3850: better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.
3851: 
3852: "There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird," said
3853: Miss Pross; "and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a
3854: mistake in life."
3855: 
3856: Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had
3857: established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
3858: who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
3859: speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
3860: no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon
3861: (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
3862: matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
3863: 
3864: "As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
3865: business," he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
3866: sat down there in friendly relations, "let me ask you--does the Doctor,
3867: in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?"
3868: 
3869: "Never."
3870: 
3871: "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?"
3872: 
3873: "Ah!" returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. "But I don't say he don't
3874: refer to it within himself."
3875: 
3876: "Do you believe that he thinks of it much?"
3877: 
3878: "I do," said Miss Pross.
3879: 
3880: "Do you imagine--" Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
3881: short with:
3882: 
3883: "Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all."
3884: 
3885: "I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
3886: sometimes?"
3887: 
3888: "Now and then," said Miss Pross.
3889: 
3890: "Do you suppose," Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
3891: bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, "that Doctor Manette has any
3892: theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
3893: the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
3894: oppressor?"
3895: 
3896: "I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me."
3897: 
3898: "And that is--?"
3899: 
3900: "That she thinks he has."
3901: 
3902: "Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
3903: mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business."
3904: 
3905: "Dull?" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
3906: 
3907: Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, "No, no,
3908: no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
3909: Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
3910: he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
3911: though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
3912: intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
3913: attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss
3914: Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
3915: zealous interest."
3916: 
3917: "Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell
3918: me," said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, "he is afraid
3919: of the whole subject."
3920: 
3921: "Afraid?"
3922: 
3923: "It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It's a dreadful
3924: remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
3925: knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
3926: feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make the
3927: subject pleasant, I should think."
3928: 
3929: It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. "True," said
3930: he, "and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
3931: Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
3932: always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
3933: it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence."
3934: 
3935: "Can't be helped," said Miss Pross, shaking her head. "Touch that
3936: string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
3937: In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in
3938: the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
3939: up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
3940: know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
3941: his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
3942: and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says
3943: a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
3944: best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
3945: together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
3946: brought him to himself."
3947: 
3948: Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a
3949: perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
3950: in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
3951: her possessing such a thing.
3952: 
3953: The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
3954: had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
3955: seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
3956: set it going.
3957: 
3958: "Here they are!" said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
3959: "and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!"
3960: 
3961: It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
3962: peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
3963: looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
3964: they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
3965: the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
3966: heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
3967: at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
3968: was ready at the street door to receive them.
3969: 
3970: Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
3971: off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
3972: with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
3973: folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
3974: as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
3975: had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant
3976: sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
3977: her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
3978: playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
3979: chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
3980: them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
3981: eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
3982: have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
3983: beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
3984: stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
3985: Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
3986: for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.
3987: 
3988: Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
3989: the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
3990: always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
3991: quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
3992: contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
3993: better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
3994: kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
3995: impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
3996: impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
3997: of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
3998: who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
3999: or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
4000: a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
4001: pleased.
4002: 
4003: On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
4004: persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
4005: regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
4006: which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
4007: Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts
4008: to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.
4009: 
4010: It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
4011: wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
4012: there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
4013: they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
4014: the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some
4015: time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
4016: plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs
4017: and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
4018: whispered to them in its own way above their heads.
4019: 
4020: Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
4021: presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
4022: was only One.
4023: 
4024: Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
4025: suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
4026: retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
4027: disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, "a fit of the
4028: jerks."
4029: 
4030: The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The
4031: resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
4032: they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
4033: his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
4034: likeness.
4035: 
4036: He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
4037: vivacity. "Pray, Doctor Manette," said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
4038: plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
4039: which happened to be the old buildings of London--"have you seen much of
4040: the Tower?"
4041: 
4042: "Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
4043: it, to know that it teems with interest; little more."
4044: 
4045: "_I_ have been there, as you remember," said Darnay, with a smile,
4046: though reddening a little angrily, "in another character, and not in a
4047: character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
4048: curious thing when I was there."
4049: 
4050: "What was that?" Lucie asked.
4051: 
4052: "In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
4053: had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
4054: its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
4055: prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
4056: in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
4057: execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with
4058: some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
4059: At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
4060: examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
4061: legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
4062: were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
4063: that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
4064: floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
4065: earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
4066: the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
4067: or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
4068: had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler."
4069: 
4070: "My father," exclaimed Lucie, "you are ill!"
4071: 
4072: He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and
4073: his look quite terrified them all.
4074: 
4075: "No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
4076: made me start. We had better go in."
4077: 
4078: He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
4079: drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he
4080: said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
4081: of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
4082: either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
4083: towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
4084: when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
4085: 
4086: He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
4087: his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
4088: steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
4089: was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
4090: that the rain had startled him.
4091: 
4092: Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
4093: her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
4094: made only Two.
4095: 
4096: The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
4097: windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
4098: done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
4099: heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
4100: leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
4101: the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
4102: ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
4103: 
4104: "The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few," said Doctor
4105: Manette. "It comes slowly."
4106: 
4107: "It comes surely," said Carton.
4108: 
4109: They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
4110: dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
4111: 
4112: There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
4113: get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
4114: resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
4115: footstep was there.
4116: 
4117: "A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!" said Darnay, when they had
4118: listened for a while.
4119: 
4120: "Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?" asked Lucie. "Sometimes, I have
4121: sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
4122: a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
4123: solemn--"
4124: 
4125: "Let us shudder too. We may know what it is."
4126: 
4127: "It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
4128: originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
4129: sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
4130: the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
4131: by-and-bye into our lives."
4132: 
4133: "There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,"
4134: Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.
4135: 
4136: The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
4137: rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
4138: as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
4139: coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
4140: the distant streets, and not one within sight.
4141: 
4142: "Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
4143: are we to divide them among us?"
4144: 
4145: "I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
4146: asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
4147: then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
4148: into my life, and my father's."
4149: 
4150: "I take them into mine!" said Carton. "_I_ ask no questions and make no
4151: stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
4152: and I see them--by the Lightning." He added the last words, after there
4153: had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.
4154: 
4155: "And I hear them!" he added again, after a peal of thunder. "Here they
4156: come, fast, fierce, and furious!"
4157: 
4158: It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
4159: for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
4160: lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's
4161: interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
4162: midnight.
4163: 
4164: The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when
4165: Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
4166: forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
4167: of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
4168: of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
4169: usually performed a good two hours earlier.
4170: 
4171: "What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry," said Mr. Lorry, "to
4172: bring the dead out of their graves."
4173: 
4174: "I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what
4175: would do that," answered Jerry.
4176: 
4177: "Good night, Mr. Carton," said the man of business. "Good night, Mr.
4178: Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!"
4179: 
4180: Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
4181: bearing down upon them, too.
4182: 
4183: 
4184: 
4185: 
4186: VII. Monseigneur in Town
4187: 
4188: 
4189: Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
4190: fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
4191: his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
4192: the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
4193: was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
4194: things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
4195: rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so
4196: much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
4197: strong men besides the Cook.
4198: 
4199: Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
4200: Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
4201: pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
4202: conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One lacquey carried
4203: the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
4204: the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
4205: a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
4206: watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
4207: dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
4208: place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
4209: his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
4210: men; he must have died of two.
4211: 
4212: Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
4213: and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
4214: a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
4215: impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
4216: more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
4217: state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
4218: for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
4219: favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
4220: days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
4221: 
4222: Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
4223: was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
4224: business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
4225: his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and
4226: particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
4227: was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original
4228: by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: "The earth and the fulness
4229: thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur."
4230: 
4231: Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
4232: his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
4233: affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
4234: public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
4235: must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
4236: private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
4237: generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
4238: Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
4239: time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
4240: wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
4241: poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
4242: a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
4243: rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
4244: mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
4245: down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
4246: 
4247: A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his
4248: stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
4249: waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
4250: forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
4251: relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
4252: among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.
4253: 
4254: For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
4255: every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
4256: achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
4257: reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
4258: so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
4259: equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
4260: have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
4261: been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
4262: destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
4263: civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
4264: worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
4265: all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
4266: pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
4267: Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
4268: anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
4269: score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
4270: yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
4271: passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
4272: no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
4273: for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
4274: patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
4275: discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
4276: State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
4277: root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
4278: they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
4279: Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
4280: card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
4281: Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
4282: wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
4283: the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
4284: since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
4285: subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
4286: exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
4287: notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
4288: among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
4289: of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
4290: the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
4291: appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
4292: bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
4293: towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
4294: known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
4295: and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
4296: supped as at twenty.
4297: 
4298: The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
4299: upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
4300: people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
4301: things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
4302: them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
4303: sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
4304: whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
4305: spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
4306: Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
4307: three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
4308: jargon about "the Centre of Truth:" holding that Man had got out of the
4309: Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
4310: out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
4311: the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
4312: by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
4313: discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
4314: became manifest.
4315: 
4316: But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
4317: Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
4318: ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
4319: correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
4320: delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
4321: swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
4322: surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
4323: of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
4324: languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
4325: and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
4326: fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
4327: his devouring hunger far away.
4328: 
4329: Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
4330: things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
4331: was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
4332: Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
4333: of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
4334: descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
4335: required to officiate "frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
4336: and white silk stockings." At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
4337: rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
4338: Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
4339: him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
4340: Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
4341: of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
4342: hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
4343: see the very stars out!
4344: 
4345: Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
4346: chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
4347: open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
4348: fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
4349: body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
4350: been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
4351: troubled it.
4352: 
4353: Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
4354: happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
4355: passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
4356: Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
4357: course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
4358: sprites, and was seen no more.
4359: 
4360: The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
4361: and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
4362: but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
4363: and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
4364: way out.
4365: 
4366: "I devote you," said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
4367: and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, "to the Devil!"
4368: 
4369: With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
4370: dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
4371: 
4372: He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
4373: with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
4374: feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
4375: beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
4376: of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
4377: change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
4378: colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
4379: by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
4380: treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
4381: attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
4382: line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
4383: too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
4384: handsome face, and a remarkable one.
4385: 
4386: Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
4387: drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
4388: stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
4389: in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
4390: to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
4391: often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were
4392: charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
4393: check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
4394: sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
4395: that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
4396: custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
4397: barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
4398: time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
4399: left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
4400: 
4401: With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
4402: consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
4403: dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
4404: before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
4405: its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
4406: wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
4407: number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
4408: 
4409: But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
4410: stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
4411: behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
4412: and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.
4413: 
4414: "What has gone wrong?" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.
4415: 
4416: A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
4417: the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
4418: down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
4419: 
4420: "Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!" said a ragged and submissive man, "it is
4421: a child."
4422: 
4423: "Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?"
4424: 
4425: "Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes."
4426: 
4427: The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
4428: into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
4429: got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
4430: Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.
4431: 
4432: "Killed!" shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
4433: their length above his head, and staring at him. "Dead!"
4434: 
4435: The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
4436: nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
4437: and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
4438: people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
4439: remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
4440: and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
4441: over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.
4442: 
4443: He took out his purse.
4444: 
4445: "It is extraordinary to me," said he, "that you people cannot take care
4446: of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
4447: the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
4448: him that."
4449: 
4450: He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
4451: craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
4452: tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, "Dead!"
4453: 
4454: He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
4455: made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
4456: sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
4457: stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
4458: were as silent, however, as the men.
4459: 
4460: "I know all, I know all," said the last comer. "Be a brave man, my
4461: Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
4462: live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
4463: as happily?"
4464: 
4465: "You are a philosopher, you there," said the Marquis, smiling. "How do
4466: they call you?"
4467: 
4468: "They call me Defarge."
4469: 
4470: "Of what trade?"
4471: 
4472: "Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine."
4473: 
4474: "Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine," said the Marquis,
4475: throwing him another gold coin, "and spend it as you will. The horses
4476: there; are they right?"
4477: 
4478: Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
4479: Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
4480: air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
4481: paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
4482: disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.
4483: 
4484: "Hold!" said Monsieur the Marquis. "Hold the horses! Who threw that?"
4485: 
4486: He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
4487: moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
4488: the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
4489: figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
4490: 
4491: "You dogs!" said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
4492: except as to the spots on his nose: "I would ride over any of you very
4493: willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
4494: threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
4495: should be crushed under the wheels."
4496: 
4497: So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
4498: what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
4499: a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
4500: But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
4501: Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
4502: contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
4503: leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word "Go on!"
4504: 
4505: He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
4506: succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
4507: Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
4508: whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
4509: had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
4510: on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
4511: spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
4512: which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
4513: bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
4514: while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
4515: of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
4516: had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
4517: of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
4518: into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
4519: time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
4520: in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
4521: things ran their course.
4522: 
4523: 
4524: 
4525: 
4526: VIII. Monseigneur in the Country
4527: 
4528: 
4529: A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
4530: Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
4531: and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
4532: inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
4533: tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
4534: disposition to give up, and wither away.
4535: 
4536: Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
4537: lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
4538: a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
4539: no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
4540: occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
4541: sun.
4542: 
4543: The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
4544: gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. "It will
4545: die out," said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, "directly."
4546: 
4547: In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
4548: heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
4549: hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
4550: quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
4551: left when the drag was taken off.
4552: 
4553: But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
4554: at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
4555: church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
4556: fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
4557: as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
4558: coming near home.
4559: 
4560: The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
4561: tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
4562: fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
4563: its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
4564: shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
4565: fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
4566: the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
4567: were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
4568: for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
4569: paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
4570: the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
4571: 
4572: Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
4573: their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
4574: terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
4575: or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
4576: 
4577: Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions'
4578: whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
4579: if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
4580: his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
4581: fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
4582: He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
4583: sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
4584: meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
4585: truth through the best part of a hundred years.
4586: 
4587: Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
4588: drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
4589: Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
4590: drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
4591: of the roads joined the group.
4592: 
4593: "Bring me hither that fellow!" said the Marquis to the courier.
4594: 
4595: The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
4596: to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
4597: 
4598: "I passed you on the road?"
4599: 
4600: "Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road."
4601: 
4602: "Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?"
4603: 
4604: "Monseigneur, it is true."
4605: 
4606: "What did you look at, so fixedly?"
4607: 
4608: "Monseigneur, I looked at the man."
4609: 
4610: He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
4611: carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
4612: 
4613: "What man, pig? And why look there?"
4614: 
4615: "Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag."
4616: 
4617: "Who?" demanded the traveller.
4618: 
4619: "Monseigneur, the man."
4620: 
4621: "May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
4622: know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?"
4623: 
4624: "Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of
4625: all the days of my life, I never saw him."
4626: 
4627: "Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?"
4628: 
4629: "With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
4630: His head hanging over--like this!"
4631: 
4632: He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
4633: face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
4634: himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
4635: 
4636: "What was he like?"
4637: 
4638: "Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
4639: white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!"
4640: 
4641: The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
4642: eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
4643: the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
4644: conscience.
4645: 
4646: "Truly, you did well," said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
4647: vermin were not to ruffle him, "to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
4648: and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
4649: Gabelle!"
4650: 
4651: Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
4652: united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
4653: examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
4654: official manner.
4655: 
4656: "Bah! Go aside!" said Monsieur Gabelle.
4657: 
4658: "Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
4659: to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle."
4660: 
4661: "Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders."
4662: 
4663: "Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?"
4664: 
4665: The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
4666: particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some
4667: half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
4668: presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
4669: 
4670: "Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?"
4671: 
4672: "Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
4673: a person plunges into the river."
4674: 
4675: "See to it, Gabelle. Go on!"
4676: 
4677: The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
4678: wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
4679: to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
4680: they might not have been so fortunate.
4681: 
4682: The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
4683: rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
4684: it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
4685: sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
4686: gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
4687: points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
4688: courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.
4689: 
4690: At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
4691: with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
4692: figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
4693: studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
4694: dreadfully spare and thin.
4695: 
4696: To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
4697: growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
4698: turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
4699: presented herself at the carriage-door.
4700: 
4701: "It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition."
4702: 
4703: With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
4704: Monseigneur looked out.
4705: 
4706: "How, then! What is it? Always petitions!"
4707: 
4708: "Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester."
4709: 
4710: "What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He
4711: cannot pay something?"
4712: 
4713: "He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead."
4714: 
4715: "Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?"
4716: 
4717: "Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
4718: grass."
4719: 
4720: "Well?"
4721: 
4722: "Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?"
4723: 
4724: "Again, well?"
4725: 
4726: She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate
4727: grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
4728: with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
4729: caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
4730: feel the appealing touch.
4731: 
4732: "Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of
4733: want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want."
4734: 
4735: "Again, well? Can I feed them?"
4736: 
4737: "Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is,
4738: that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed
4739: over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly
4740: forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
4741: shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they
4742: are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!
4743: Monseigneur!"
4744: 
4745: The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into
4746: a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far
4747: behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
4748: diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
4749: his chateau.
4750: 
4751: The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as
4752: the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
4753: at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
4754: of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his
4755: man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
4756: could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
4757: in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
4758: stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
4759: been extinguished.
4760: 
4761: The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
4762: was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
4763: for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door
4764: of his chateau was opened to him.
4765: 
4766: "Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?"
4767: 
4768: "Monseigneur, not yet."
4769: 
4770: 
4771: 
4772: 
4773: IX. The Gorgon's Head
4774: 
4775: 
4776: It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
4777: with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
4778: staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony
4779: business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
4780: stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
4781: all directions. As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was
4782: finished, two centuries ago.
4783: 
4784: Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
4785: preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
4786: to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
4787: of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
4788: flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
4789: door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
4790: in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl's voice there was none,
4791: save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
4792: those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
4793: heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
4794: 
4795: The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
4796: hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
4797: grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
4798: peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord
4799: was angry.
4800: 
4801: Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
4802: Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
4803: the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him
4804: to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two
4805: others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
4806: the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
4807: befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
4808: The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
4809: break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
4810: but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
4811: pages in the history of France.
4812: 
4813: A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
4814: room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
4815: lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
4816: closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
4817: black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
4818: 
4819: "My nephew," said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; "they
4820: said he was not arrived."
4821: 
4822: Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.
4823: 
4824: "Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
4825: table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour."
4826: 
4827: In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his
4828: sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and
4829: he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his
4830: lips, when he put it down.
4831: 
4832: "What is that?" he calmly asked, looking with attention at the
4833: horizontal lines of black and stone colour.
4834: 
4835: "Monseigneur? That?"
4836: 
4837: "Outside the blinds. Open the blinds."
4838: 
4839: It was done.
4840: 
4841: "Well?"
4842: 
4843: "Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
4844: here."
4845: 
4846: The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
4847: the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round
4848: for instructions.
4849: 
4850: "Good," said the imperturbable master. "Close them again."
4851: 
4852: That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was
4853: half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,
4854: hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the
4855: front of the chateau.
4856: 
4857: "Ask who is arrived."
4858: 
4859: It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind
4860: Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance
4861: rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
4862: He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.
4863: 
4864: He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
4865: there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.
4866: He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.
4867: 
4868: Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
4869: hands.
4870: 
4871: "You left Paris yesterday, sir?" he said to Monseigneur, as he took his
4872: seat at table.
4873: 
4874: "Yesterday. And you?"
4875: 
4876: "I come direct."
4877: 
4878: "From London?"
4879: 
4880: "Yes."
4881: 
4882: "You have been a long time coming," said the Marquis, with a smile.
4883: 
4884: "On the contrary; I come direct."
4885: 
4886: "Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
4887: intending the journey."
4888: 
4889: "I have been detained by"--the nephew stopped a moment in his
4890: answer--"various business."
4891: 
4892: "Without doubt," said the polished uncle.
4893: 
4894: So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
4895: When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
4896: looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
4897: fine mask, opened a conversation.
4898: 
4899: "I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
4900: took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
4901: a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
4902: sustained me."
4903: 
4904: "Not to death," said the uncle; "it is not necessary to say, to death."
4905: 
4906: "I doubt, sir," returned the nephew, "whether, if it had carried me to
4907: the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there."
4908: 
4909: The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
4910: lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
4911: graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
4912: breeding that it was not reassuring.
4913: 
4914: "Indeed, sir," pursued the nephew, "for anything I know, you may have
4915: expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
4916: circumstances that surrounded me."
4917: 
4918: "No, no, no," said the uncle, pleasantly.
4919: 
4920: "But, however that may be," resumed the nephew, glancing at him with
4921: deep distrust, "I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
4922: and would know no scruple as to means."
4923: 
4924: "My friend, I told you so," said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
4925: two marks. "Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago."
4926: 
4927: "I recall it."
4928: 
4929: "Thank you," said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.
4930: 
4931: His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
4932: instrument.
4933: 
4934: "In effect, sir," pursued the nephew, "I believe it to be at once your
4935: bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
4936: France here."
4937: 
4938: "I do not quite understand," returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
4939: "Dare I ask you to explain?"
4940: 
4941: "I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
4942: been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
4943: have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."
4944: 
4945: "It is possible," said the uncle, with great calmness. "For the honour
4946: of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
4947: Pray excuse me!"
4948: 
4949: "I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
4950: yesterday was, as usual, a cold one," observed the nephew.
4951: 
4952: "I would not say happily, my friend," returned the uncle, with refined
4953: politeness; "I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
4954: consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
4955: your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
4956: yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
4957: at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
4958: aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
4959: might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
4960: and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
4961: (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
4962: things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right
4963: of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
4964: dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
4965: one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
4966: some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have
4967: lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
4968: assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
4969: to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
4970: bad!"
4971: 
4972: The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
4973: as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
4974: containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
4975: 
4976: "We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
4977: time also," said the nephew, gloomily, "that I believe our name to be
4978: more detested than any name in France."
4979: 
4980: "Let us hope so," said the uncle. "Detestation of the high is the
4981: involuntary homage of the low."
4982: 
4983: "There is not," pursued the nephew, in his former tone, "a face I can
4984: look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
4985: deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery."
4986: 
4987: "A compliment," said the Marquis, "to the grandeur of the family,
4988: merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
4989: Hah!" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
4990: crossed his legs.
4991: 
4992: But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes
4993: thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
4994: him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
4995: and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of
4996: indifference.
4997: 
4998: "Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear
4999: and slavery, my friend," observed the Marquis, "will keep the dogs
5000: obedient to the whip, as long as this roof," looking up to it, "shuts
5001: out the sky."
5002: 
5003: That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the
5004: chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
5005: they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
5006: him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
5007: the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
5008: he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
5009: way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
5010: was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
5011: 
5012: "Meanwhile," said the Marquis, "I will preserve the honour and repose
5013: of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
5014: terminate our conference for the night?"
5015: 
5016: "A moment more."
5017: 
5018: "An hour, if you please."
5019: 
5020: "Sir," said the nephew, "we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
5021: of wrong."
5022: 
5023: "_We_ have done wrong?" repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
5024: and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
5025: 
5026: "Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
5027: to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time, we did
5028: a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
5029: our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time,
5030: when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint
5031: inheritor, and next successor, from himself?"
5032: 
5033: "Death has done that!" said the Marquis.
5034: 
5035: "And has left me," answered the nephew, "bound to a system that is
5036: frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
5037: execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last
5038: look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
5039: redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain."
5040: 
5041: "Seeking them from me, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching him on the
5042: breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--"you
5043: will for ever seek them in vain, be assured."
5044: 
5045: Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
5046: cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
5047: quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he
5048: touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
5049: a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
5050: body, and said,
5051: 
5052: "My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
5053: lived."
5054: 
5055: When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
5056: box in his pocket.
5057: 
5058: "Better to be a rational creature," he added then, after ringing a small
5059: bell on the table, "and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
5060: Monsieur Charles, I see."
5061: 
5062: "This property and France are lost to me," said the nephew, sadly; "I
5063: renounce them."
5064: 
5065: "Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It
5066: is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?"
5067: 
5068: "I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
5069: to me from you, to-morrow--"
5070: 
5071: "Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable."
5072: 
5073: "--or twenty years hence--"
5074: 
5075: "You do me too much honour," said the Marquis; "still, I prefer that
5076: supposition."
5077: 
5078: "--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
5079: relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!"
5080: 
5081: "Hah!" said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.
5082: 
5083: "To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
5084: under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
5085: mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
5086: and suffering."
5087: 
5088: "Hah!" said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.
5089: 
5090: "If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
5091: qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
5092: weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
5093: it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
5094: another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
5095: on it, and on all this land."
5096: 
5097: "And you?" said the uncle. "Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
5098: philosophy, graciously intend to live?"
5099: 
5100: "I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
5101: their backs, may have to do some day--work."
5102: 
5103: "In England, for example?"
5104: 
5105: "Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
5106: family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other."
5107: 
5108: The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
5109: lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The
5110: Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
5111: valet.
5112: 
5113: "England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
5114: prospered there," he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
5115: with a smile.
5116: 
5117: "I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
5118: be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge."
5119: 
5120: "They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
5121: know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?"
5122: 
5123: "Yes."
5124: 
5125: "With a daughter?"
5126: 
5127: "Yes."
5128: 
5129: "Yes," said the Marquis. "You are fatigued. Good night!"
5130: 
5131: As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
5132: in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
5133: which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same
5134: time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
5135: straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
5136: looked handsomely diabolic.
5137: 
5138: "Yes," repeated the Marquis. "A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
5139: commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!"
5140: 
5141: It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
5142: outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew
5143: looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.
5144: 
5145: "Good night!" said the uncle. "I look to the pleasure of seeing you
5146: again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
5147: chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will," he
5148: added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
5149: valet to his own bedroom.
5150: 
5151: The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
5152: loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
5153: night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no
5154: noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
5155: enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
5156: periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
5157: coming on.
5158: 
5159: He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
5160: scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
5161: toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
5162: prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
5163: the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
5164: chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
5165: the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
5166: tall man with his arms up, crying, "Dead!"
5167: 
5168: "I am cool now," said Monsieur the Marquis, "and may go to bed."
5169: 
5170: So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
5171: gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
5172: with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.
5173: 
5174: The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
5175: for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
5176: rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
5177: very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
5178: the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
5179: hardly ever to say what is set down for them.
5180: 
5181: For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
5182: stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
5183: dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
5184: The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
5185: were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
5186: have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
5187: taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
5188: the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
5189: the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
5190: freed.
5191: 
5192: The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
5193: at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
5194: minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
5195: hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
5196: and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
5197: 
5198: Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
5199: trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water
5200: of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
5201: crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
5202: weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
5203: the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
5204: At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
5205: mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
5206: 
5207: Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement
5208: windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
5209: shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely
5210: lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the
5211: fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
5212: and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
5213: out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church
5214: and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
5215: prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
5216: foot.
5217: 
5218: The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
5219: surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
5220: reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
5221: now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
5222: round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
5223: doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
5224: pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
5225: 
5226: All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
5227: return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
5228: chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
5229: figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
5230: everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
5231: 
5232: What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
5233: at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not
5234: much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
5235: peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
5236: to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
5237: no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
5238: down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
5239: fountain.
5240: 
5241: All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
5242: in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
5243: emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
5244: in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
5245: on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
5246: trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
5247: the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
5248: all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
5249: on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
5250: highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
5251: into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
5252: himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,
5253: and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
5254: a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
5255: (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
5256: the German ballad of Leonora?
5257: 
5258: It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.
5259: 
5260: The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
5261: the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
5262: through about two hundred years.
5263: 
5264: It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
5265: mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the
5266: heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
5267: was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:
5268: 
5269: "Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques."
5270: 
5271: 
5272: 
5273: 
5274: X. Two Promises
5275: 
5276: 
5277: More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
5278: Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
5279: language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he
5280: would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with
5281: young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
5282: living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
5283: its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in
5284: sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
5285: at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
5286: to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
5287: dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a
5288: tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
5289: profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
5290: work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
5291: known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
5292: circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
5293: So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.
5294: 
5295: In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
5296: to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
5297: would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
5298: did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.
5299: 
5300: A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
5301: read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
5302: contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
5303: and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
5304: London.
5305: 
5306: Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
5307: when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
5308: invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a
5309: woman.
5310: 
5311: He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never
5312: heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
5313: he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
5314: confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
5315: him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
5316: at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
5317: long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
5318: mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
5319: much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.
5320: 
5321: That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
5322: summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
5323: he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
5324: of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
5325: day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.
5326: 
5327: He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy
5328: which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
5329: their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a
5330: very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
5331: of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
5332: sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
5333: exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
5334: frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
5335: 
5336: He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
5337: ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
5338: sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
5339: 
5340: "Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
5342: both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due."
5343: 
5344: "I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter," he answered,
5345: a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. "Miss
5346: Manette--"
5347: 
5348: "Is well," said the Doctor, as he stopped short, "and your return will
5349: delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will
5350: soon be home."
5351: 
5352: "Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her
5353: being from home, to beg to speak to you."
5354: 
5355: There was a blank silence.
5356: 
5357: "Yes?" said the Doctor, with evident constraint. "Bring your chair here,
5358: and speak on."
5359: 
5360: He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
5361: easy.
5362: 
5363: "I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,"
5364: so he at length began, "for some year and a half, that I hope the topic
5365: on which I am about to touch may not--"
5366: 
5367: He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he
5368: had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:
5369: 
5370: "Is Lucie the topic?"
5371: 
5372: "She is."
5373: 
5374: "It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
5375: to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay."
5376: 
5377: "It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
5378: Manette!" he said deferentially.
5379: 
5380: There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:
5381: 
5382: "I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it."
5383: 
5384: His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
5385: originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
5386: Darnay hesitated.
5387: 
5388: "Shall I go on, sir?"
5389: 
5390: Another blank.
5391: 
5392: "Yes, go on."
5393: 
5394: "You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
5395: I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
5396: the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
5397: laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
5398: disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
5399: her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!"
5400: 
5401: The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
5402: ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
5403: and cried:
5404: 
5405: "Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!"
5406: 
5407: His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
5408: Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
5409: extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
5410: so received it, and remained silent.
5411: 
5412: "I ask your pardon," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
5413: moments. "I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it."
5414: 
5415: He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
5416: raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
5417: overshadowed his face:
5418: 
5419: "Have you spoken to Lucie?"
5420: 
5421: "No."
5422: 
5423: "Nor written?"
5424: 
5425: "Never."
5426: 
5427: "It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
5428: to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
5429: you."
5430: 
5431: He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
5432: 
5433: "I know," said Darnay, respectfully, "how can I fail to know, Doctor
5434: Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
5435: you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
5436: belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
5437: can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
5438: child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
5439: with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
5440: is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
5441: itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
5442: now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
5443: years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
5444: early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
5445: you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
5446: hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
5447: in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
5448: you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
5449: neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
5450: own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
5451: loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
5452: have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home."
5453: 
5454: Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
5455: little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
5456: 
5457: "Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
5458: with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
5459: long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
5460: now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
5461: your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
5462: Heaven is my witness that I love her!"
5463: 
5464: "I believe it," answered her father, mournfully. "I have thought so
5465: before now. I believe it."
5466: 
5467: "But, do not believe," said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
5468: struck with a reproachful sound, "that if my fortune were so cast as
5469: that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
5470: put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
5471: word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
5472: should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
5473: a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
5474: heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
5475: now touch this honoured hand."
5476: 
5477: He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
5478: 
5479: "No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
5480: you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
5481: you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
5482: in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
5483: life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
5484: with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
5485: come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be."
5486: 
5487: His touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering the touch for a
5488: moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
5489: his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
5490: conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
5491: occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
5492: 
5493: "You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
5494: you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
5495: you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?"
5496: 
5497: "None. As yet, none."
5498: 
5499: "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
5500: ascertain that, with my knowledge?"
5501: 
5502: "Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
5503: might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow."
5504: 
5505: "Do you seek any guidance from me?"
5506: 
5507: "I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
5508: in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some."
5509: 
5510: "Do you seek any promise from me?"
5511: 
5512: "I do seek that."
5513: 
5514: "What is it?"
5515: 
5516: "I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
5517: understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
5518: innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
5519: could retain no place in it against her love for her father."
5520: 
5521: "If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?"
5522: 
5523: "I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's
5524: favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,
5525: Doctor Manette," said Darnay, modestly but firmly, "I would not ask that
5526: word, to save my life."
5527: 
5528: "I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
5529: well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
5530: delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
5531: respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
5532: heart."
5533: 
5534: "May I ask, sir, if you think she is--" As he hesitated, her father
5535: supplied the rest.
5536: 
5537: "Is sought by any other suitor?"
5538: 
5539: "It is what I meant to say."
5540: 
5541: Her father considered a little before he answered:
5542: 
5543: "You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
5544: occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these."
5545: 
5546: "Or both," said Darnay.
5547: 
5548: "I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
5549: a promise from me. Tell me what it is."
5550: 
5551: "It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
5552: part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
5553: bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
5554: may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
5555: me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
5556: condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
5557: require, I will observe immediately."
5558: 
5559: "I give the promise," said the Doctor, "without any condition. I believe
5560: your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
5561: believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
5562: between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
5563: that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
5564: If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--"
5565: 
5566: The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
5567: the Doctor spoke:
5568: 
5569: "--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
5570: new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
5571: thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
5572: sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
5573: than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk."
5574: 
5575: So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
5576: his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
5577: hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
5578: 
5579: "You said something to me," said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.
5580: "What was it you said to me?"
5581: 
5582: He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
5583: condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:
5584: 
5585: "Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
5586: part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is
5587: not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
5588: why I am in England."
5589: 
5590: "Stop!" said the Doctor of Beauvais.
5591: 
5592: "I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
5593: secret from you."
5594: 
5595: "Stop!"
5596: 
5597: For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
5598: another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.
5599: 
5600: "Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
5601: should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
5602: promise?"
5603: 
5604: "Willingly.
5605: 
5606: "Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
5607: should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!"
5608: 
5609: It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
5610: darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
5611: Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
5612: reading-chair empty.
5613: 
5614: "My father!" she called to him. "Father dear!"
5615: 
5616: Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
5617: bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
5618: his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
5619: blood all chilled, "What shall I do! What shall I do!"
5620: 
5621: Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
5622: his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
5623: her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
5624: together for a long time.
5625: 
5626: She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He
5627: slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
5628: work, were all as usual.
5629:

5633: XI. A Companion Picture
5634: 
5635: 
5636: "Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
5637: jackal; "mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you."
5638: 
5639: Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
5640: and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
5641: a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in
5642: of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
5643: arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
5644: November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
5645: bring grist to the mill again.
5646: 
5647: Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
5648: application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
5649: through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
5650: the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
5651: his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
5652: intervals for the last six hours.
5653: 
5654: "Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?" said Stryver the portly, with
5655: his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
5656: his back.
5657: 
5658: "I am."
5659: 
5660: "Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
5661: surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
5662: shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry."
5663: 
5664: "_Do_ you?"
5665: 
5666: "Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?"
5667: 
5668: "I don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she?"
5669: 
5670: "Guess."
5671: 
5672: "Do I know her?"
5673: 
5674: "Guess."
5675: 
5676: "I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in the morning, with my brains
5677: frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
5678: me to dinner."
5679: 
5680: "Well then, I'll tell you," said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
5681: posture. "Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
5682: because you are such an insensible dog."
5683: 
5684: "And you," returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, "are such a
5685: sensitive and poetical spirit--"
5686: 
5687: "Come!" rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, "though I don't prefer
5688: any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
5689: I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_."
5690: 
5691: "You are a luckier, if you mean that."
5692: 
5693: "I don't mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--"
5694: 
5695: "Say gallantry, while you are about it," suggested Carton.
5696: 
5697: "Well! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man," said Stryver,
5698: inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, "who cares more to
5699: be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
5700: to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do."
5701: 
5703: 
5704: "No; but before I go on," said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
5705: way, "I'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's house
5706: as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
5707: moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
5708: hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
5709: Sydney!"
5710: 
5711: "It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
5712: be ashamed of anything," returned Sydney; "you ought to be much obliged
5713: to me."
5714: 
5715: "You shall not get off in that way," rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
5716: rejoinder at him; "no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you
5717: to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
5718: fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow."
5719: 
5720: Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.
5721: 
5722: "Look at me!" said Stryver, squaring himself; "I have less need to make
5723: myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
5724: Why do I do it?"
5725: 
5726: "I never saw you do it yet," muttered Carton.
5727: 
5728: "I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
5729: get on."
5730: 
5731: "You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,"
5732: answered Carton, with a careless air; "I wish you would keep to that. As
5733: to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?"
5734: 
5735: He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
5736: 
5737: "You have no business to be incorrigible," was his friend's answer,
5738: delivered in no very soothing tone.
5739: 
5741: "Who is the lady?"
5742: 
5743: "Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
5744: Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
5745: for the disclosure he was about to make, "because I know you don't mean
5746: half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
5747: make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
5748: me in slighting terms."
5749: 
5750: "I did?"
5751: 
5752: "Certainly; and in these chambers."
5753: 
5754: Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
5755: drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.
5756: 
5757: "You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young
5758: lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
5759: delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
5760: little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
5761: You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
5762: think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of
5763: a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
5764: of mine, who had no ear for music."
5765: 
5766: Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
5767: looking at his friend.
5768: 
5769: "Now you know all about it, Syd," said Mr. Stryver. "I don't care about
5770: fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
5771: please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
5772: will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
5773: and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,
5774: but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?"
5775: 
5776: Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I be
5777: astonished?"
5778: 
5779: "You approve?"
5780: 
5781: Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I not approve?"
5782: 
5783: "Well!" said his friend Stryver, "you take it more easily than I fancied
5784: you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
5785: be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
5786: ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
5787: enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
5788: feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
5789: inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel
5790: that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
5791: credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
5792: say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
5793: know; you really are in a bad way. You don't know the value of money,
5794: you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
5795: you really ought to think about a nurse."
5796: 
5797: The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
5798: big as he was, and four times as offensive.
5799: 
5800: "Now, let me recommend you," pursued Stryver, "to look it in the face.
5801: I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
5802: you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
5803: you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor
5804: understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
5805: respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
5806: or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That's the
5807: kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney."
5808: 
5809: "I'll think of it," said Sydney.
5810: 
5811: 
5812: 
5813: 
5814: XII. The Fellow of Delicacy
5815: 
5816: 
5817: Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
5818: fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
5819: to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental
5820: debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as
5821: well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
5822: at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
5823: before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
5824: and Hilary.
5825: 
5826: As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
5827: saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
5828: grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
5829: plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the
5830: plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
5831: the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
5832: consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
5833: case could be.
5834: 
5835: Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
5836: proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
5837: Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
5838: himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.
5839: 
5840: Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,
5841: while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.
5842: Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
5843: on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
5844: along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
5845: seen how safe and strong he was.
5846: 
5847: His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and
5848: knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
5849: Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
5850: of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
5851: in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
5852: cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
5853: Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
5854: bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
5855: under the clouds were a sum.
5856: 
5857: "Halloa!" said Mr. Stryver. "How do you do? I hope you are well!"
5858: 
5859: It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
5860: place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks
5861: in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
5862: squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
5863: the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
5864: the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
5865: 
5866: The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
5867: recommend under the circumstances, "How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
5868: you do, sir?" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner
5869: of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook
5870: hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a
5871: self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.
5872: 
5873: "Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?" asked Mr. Lorry, in his
5874: business character.
5875: 
5876: "Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
5877: have come for a private word."
5878: 
5879: "Oh indeed!" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
5880: to the House afar off.
5881: 
5882: "I am going," said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
5883: desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
5884: be not half desk enough for him: "I am going to make an offer of myself
5885: in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry."
5886: 
5887: "Oh dear me!" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
5888: visitor dubiously.
5889: 
5890: "Oh dear me, sir?" repeated Stryver, drawing back. "Oh dear you, sir?
5891: What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?"
5892: 
5893: "My meaning," answered the man of business, "is, of course, friendly and
5894: appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
5895: my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
5896: Stryver--" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
5897: manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
5898: "you know there really is so much too much of you!"
5899: 
5900: "Well!" said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
5901: opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, "if I understand you,
5902: Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!"
5903: 
5904: Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
5905: end, and bit the feather of a pen.
5906: 
5907: "D--n it all, sir!" said Stryver, staring at him, "am I not eligible?"
5908: 
5909: "Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!" said Mr. Lorry. "If you say
5910: eligible, you are eligible."
5911: 
5912: "Am I not prosperous?" asked Stryver.
5913: 
5914: "Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous," said Mr. Lorry.
5915: 
5916: "And advancing?"
5917: 
5918: "If you come to advancing you know," said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
5919: able to make another admission, "nobody can doubt that."
5920: 
5921: "Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?" demanded Stryver,
5922: perceptibly crestfallen.
5923: 
5924: "Well! I--Were you going there now?" asked Mr. Lorry.
5925: 
5926: "Straight!" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.
5927: 
5928: "Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you."
5929: 
5930: "Why?" said Stryver. "Now, I'll put you in a corner," forensically
5931: shaking a forefinger at him. "You are a man of business and bound to
5932: have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?"
5933: 
5934: "Because," said Mr. Lorry, "I wouldn't go on such an object without
5935: having some cause to believe that I should succeed."
5936: 
5937: "D--n _me_!" cried Stryver, "but this beats everything."
5938: 
5939: Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
5940: Stryver.
5941: 
5942: "Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
5943: a Bank," said Stryver; "and having summed up three leading reasons for
5944: complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his
5945: head on!" Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
5946: been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.
5947: 
5948: "When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
5949: when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
5950: causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young
5951: lady, my good sir," said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, "the
5952: young lady. The young lady goes before all."
5953: 
5954: "Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver, squaring his
5955: elbows, "that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
5956: present in question is a mincing Fool?"
5957: 
5958: "Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver," said Mr. Lorry,
5959: reddening, "that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
5960: from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
5961: taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
5962: not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
5963: this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my
5964: mind."
5965: 
5966: The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's
5967: blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
5968: Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
5969: no better state now it was his turn.
5970: 
5971: "That is what I mean to tell you, sir," said Mr. Lorry. "Pray let there
5972: be no mistake about it."
5973: 
5974: Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
5975: hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
5976: toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:
5977: 
5978: "This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
5979: to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench
5980: bar?"
5981: 
5982: "Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?"
5983: 
5984: "Yes, I do."
5985: 
5986: "Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly."
5987: 
5988: "And all I can say of it is," laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, "that
5989: this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come."
5990: 
5991: "Now understand me," pursued Mr. Lorry. "As a man of business, I am
5992: not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
5993: business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
5994: Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
5995: of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
5996: spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
5997: may not be right?"
5998: 
5999: "Not I!" said Stryver, whistling. "I can't undertake to find third
6000: parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
6001: in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's
6002: new to me, but you are right, I dare say."
6003: 
6004: "What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
6005: understand me, sir," said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, "I
6006: will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any
6007: gentleman breathing."
6008: 
6009: "There! I beg your pardon!" said Stryver.
6010: 
6011: "Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
6012: painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
6013: Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
6014: painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You
6015: know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
6016: the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
6017: in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
6018: little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
6019: it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
6020: soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
6021: with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
6022: best spared. What do you say?"
6023: 
6024: "How long would you keep me in town?"
6025: 
6026: "Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
6027: evening, and come to your chambers afterwards."
6028: 
6029: "Then I say yes," said Stryver: "I won't go up there now, I am not so
6030: hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
6031: in to-night. Good morning."
6032: 
6033: Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
6034: concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
6035: bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
6036: of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
6037: always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
6038: believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
6039: the empty office until they bowed another customer in.
6040: 
6041: The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
6042: gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
6043: moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
6044: swallow, he got it down. "And now," said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
6045: forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, "my way
6046: out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong."
6047: 
6048: It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
6049: great relief. "You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady," said Mr.
6050: Stryver; "I'll do that for you."
6051: 
6052: Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,
6053: Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
6054: purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
6055: the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
6056: altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.
6057: 
6058: "Well!" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
6059: bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. "I have been to
6060: Soho."
6061: 
6062: "To Soho?" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. "Oh, to be sure! What am I
6063: thinking of!"
6064: 
6065: "And I have no doubt," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was right in the
6066: conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
6067: advice."
6068: 
6069: "I assure you," returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, "that I
6070: am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's
6071: account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
6072: us say no more about it."
6073: 
6074: "I don't understand you," said Mr. Lorry.
6075: 
6076: "I dare say not," rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
6077: final way; "no matter, no matter."
6078: 
6079: "But it does matter," Mr. Lorry urged.
6080: 
6081: "No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was
6082: sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
6083: not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
6084: done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
6085: repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
6086: aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
6087: a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
6088: glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
6089: for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
6090: have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
6091: proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
6092: certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
6093: that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
6094: giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
6095: will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
6096: I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
6097: And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
6098: and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
6099: you were right, it never would have done."
6100: 
6101: Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
6102: Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
6103: showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
6104: "Make the best of it, my dear sir," said Stryver; "say no more about it;
6105: thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!"
6106: 
6107: Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver
6108: was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.
6109: 
6110: 
6111: 
6112: 
6113: XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy
6114: 
6115: 
6117: house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
6118: and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he
6119: cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
6120: which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
6121: pierced by the light within him.
6122: 
6123: And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
6124: and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
6125: he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
6126: transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
6127: figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
6128: of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
6129: in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
6130: brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
6131: into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
6132: him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
6133: it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
6134: neighbourhood.
6135: 
6136: On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
6137: that "he had thought better of that marrying matter") had carried his
6138: delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
6139: City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
6140: for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod
6141: those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
6142: animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
6143: they took him to the Doctor's door.
6144: 
6145: He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had
6146: never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
6147: embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at
6148: his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed
6149: a change in it.
6150: 
6151: "I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!"
6152: 
6153: "No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
6154: is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?"
6155: 
6156: "Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
6157: live no better life?"
6158: 
6159: "God knows it is a shame!"
6160: 
6161: "Then why not change it?"
6162: 
6163: Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
6164: there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
6165: answered:
6166: 
6167: "It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
6168: sink lower, and be worse."
6169: 
6170: He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The
6171: table trembled in the silence that followed.
6172: 
6173: She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to
6174: be so, without looking at her, and said:
6175: 
6176: "Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of
6177: what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?"
6178: 
6179: "If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
6180: it would make me very glad!"
6181: 
6182: "God bless you for your sweet compassion!"
6183: 
6184: He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.
6185: 
6186: "Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like
6187: one who died young. All my life might have been."
6188: 
6189: "No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
6190: sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself."
6191: 
6192: "Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
6193: mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
6194: it!"
6195: 
6196: She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair
6197: of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
6198: been holden.
6199: 
6200: "If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
6201: love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
6202: poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
6203: conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
6204: bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
6205: disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have
6206: no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
6207: be."
6208: 
6209: "Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
6210: you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
6211: confidence? I know this is a confidence," she modestly said, after a
6212: little hesitation, and in earnest tears, "I know you would say this to
6213: no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?"
6214: 
6215: He shook his head.
6216: 
6217: "To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
6218: little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
6219: you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
6220: been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
6221: home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
6222: died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
6223: I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
6224: old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
6225: have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
6226: sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all
6227: a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
6228: but I wish you to know that you inspired it."
6229: 
6230: "Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!"
6231: 
6232: "No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
6233: undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
6234: weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
6235: heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
6236: its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
6237: service, idly burning away."
6238: 
6239: "Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
6240: than you were before you knew me--"
6241: 
6242: "Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
6243: anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse."
6244: 
6245: "Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
6246: attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
6247: make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
6248: good, with you, at all?"
6249: 
6250: "The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
6251: here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
6252: the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
6253: and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
6254: deplore and pity."
6255: 
6256: "Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
6257: all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!"
6258: 
6259: "Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
6260: and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
6261: me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
6262: was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
6263: alone, and will be shared by no one?"
6264: 
6265: "If that will be a consolation to you, yes."
6266: 
6267: "Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?"
6268: 
6269: "Mr. Carton," she answered, after an agitated pause, "the secret is
6270: yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it."
6271: 
6272: "Thank you. And again, God bless you."
6273: 
6274: He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.
6275: 
6276: "Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
6277: conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it
6278: again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
6279: the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
6280: shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
6281: to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
6282: in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!"
6283: 
6284: He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
6285: sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
6286: down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
6287: stood looking back at her.
6288: 
6289: "Be comforted!" he said, "I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
6290: hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
6291: but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
6292: wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
6293: shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
6294: what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
6295: to you, is, that you will believe this of me."
6296: 
6297: "I will, Mr. Carton."
6298: 
6299: "My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
6300: you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
6301: between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
6302: it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
6303: you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
6304: there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
6305: embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
6306: me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
6307: thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
6308: ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
6309: and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
6310: grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
6311: happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
6312: beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
6313: a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!"
6314: 
6315: He said, "Farewell!" said a last "God bless you!" and left her.
6316: 
6317: 
6318: 
6319: 
6320: XIV. The Honest Tradesman
6321: 
6322: 
6323: To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
6324: Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
6325: variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
6326: upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
6327: not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
6328: westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
6329: both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
6330: the sun goes down!
6331: 
6332: With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
6333: like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
6334: watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
6335: running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
6336: since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
6337: women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
6338: Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such
6339: companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
6340: to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
6341: have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from
6342: the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
6343: purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.
6344: 
6345: Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
6346: the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
6347: but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
6348: 
6349: It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
6350: few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
6351: unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
6352: Cruncher must have been "flopping" in some pointed manner, when an
6353: unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
6354: attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
6355: funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
6356: funeral, which engendered uproar.
6357: 
6358: "Young Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, "it's a
6359: buryin'."
6360: 
6361: "Hooroar, father!" cried Young Jerry.
6362: 
6363: The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
6364: significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
6365: his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
6366: 
6367: "What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
6368: to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for
6369: _me_!" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. "Him and his hooroars! Don't
6370: let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D'ye
6371: hear?"
6372: 
6373: "I warn't doing no harm," Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
6374: 
6375: "Drop it then," said Mr. Cruncher; "I won't have none of _your_ no
6376: harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd."
6377: 
6378: His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
6379: round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
6380: there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
6381: considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position
6382: appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
6383: surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
6384: incessantly groaning and calling out: "Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!"
6385: with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.
6386: 
6387: Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
6388: always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
6389: Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
6390: excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:
6391: 
6392: "What is it, brother? What's it about?"
6393: 
6394: "_I_ don't know," said the man. "Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!"
6395: 
6396: He asked another man. "Who is it?"
6397: 
6398: "_I_ don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
6399: nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
6400: greatest ardour, "Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!"
6401: 
6402: At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
6403: against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
6404: funeral of one Roger Cly.
6405: 
6406: "Was he a spy?" asked Mr. Cruncher.
6407: 
6408: "Old Bailey spy," returned his informant. "Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
6409: Spi--i--ies!"
6410: 
6411: "Why, to be sure!" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
6412: assisted. "I've seen him. Dead, is he?"
6413: 
6414: "Dead as mutton," returned the other, "and can't be too dead. Have 'em
6415: out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!"
6416: 
6417: The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
6418: that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
6419: suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles
6420: so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach
6421: doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands
6422: for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
6423: that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
6424: shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
6425: other symbolical tears.
6426: 
6427: These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
6428: enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
6429: crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
6430: They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
6431: out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
6432: its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
6433: much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
6434: the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
6435: while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
6436: exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
6437: was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
6438: the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning
6439: coach.
6440: 
6441: The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
6442: the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
6443: remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
6444: members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
6445: The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
6446: hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
6447: close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
6448: by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
6449: popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
6450: ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
6451: bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
6452: that part of the procession in which he walked.
6453: 
6454: Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
6455: caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
6456: at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
6457: was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
6458: in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
6459: accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
6460: highly to its own satisfaction.
6461: 
6462: The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
6463: providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
6464: genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
6465: passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
6466: was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
6467: the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
6468: they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
6469: window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
6470: and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
6471: been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
6472: the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
6473: coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
6474: the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
6475: progress of a mob.
6476: 
6477: Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
6478: behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
6479: The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a
6480: neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
6481: maturely considering the spot.
6482: 
6483: "Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
6484: "you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
6485: was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."
6486: 
6487: Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
6488: himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
6489: station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
6490: his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
6491: amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
6492: man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
6493: his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.
6494: 
6495: Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
6496: job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
6497: usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.
6498: 
6499: "Now, I tell you where it is!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
6500: entering. "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
6501: shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you
6502: for it just the same as if I seen you do it."
6503: 
6504: The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
6505: 
6506: "Why, you're at it afore my face!" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
6507: angry apprehension.
6508: 
6509: "I am saying nothing."
6510: 
6511: "Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
6512: You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether."
6513: 
6514: "Yes, Jerry."
6515: 
6516: "Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. "Ah! It _is_
6517: yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry."
6518: 
6519: Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
6520: but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
6521: ironical dissatisfaction.
6522: 
6523: "You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
6524: bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
6525: oyster out of his saucer. "Ah! I think so. I believe you."
6526: 
6527: "You are going out to-night?" asked his decent wife, when he took
6528: another bite.
6529: 
6530: "Yes, I am."
6531: 
6532: "May I go with you, father?" asked his son, briskly.
6533: 
6534: "No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's
6535: where I'm going to. Going a fishing."
6536: 
6537: "Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"
6538: 
6539: "Never you mind."
6540: 
6541: "Shall you bring any fish home, father?"
6542: 
6543: "If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that
6544: gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions enough for you; I ain't a
6545: going out, till you've been long abed."
6546: 
6547: He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
6548: most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
6549: conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
6550: to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
6551: conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
6552: on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
6553: he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest
6554: person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
6555: honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a
6556: professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
6557: 
6558: "And mind you!" said Mr. Cruncher. "No games to-morrow! If I, as a
6559: honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
6560: of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
6561: tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
6562: on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
6563: customer to you, if you don't. _I_'m your Rome, you know."
6564: 
6565: Then he began grumbling again:
6566: 
6567: "With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don't
6568: know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your
6569: flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_
6570: your'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
6571: and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?"
6572: 
6573: This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to
6574: perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
6575: all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
6576: function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.
6577: 
6578: Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
6579: was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
6580: obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
6581: solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
6582: o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
6583: took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
6584: forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
6585: fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him
6586: in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
6587: extinguished the light, and went out.
6588: 
6589: Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
6590: bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
6591: followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
6592: court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
6593: his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
6594: door stood ajar all night.
6595: 
6596: Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
6597: father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
6598: walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
6599: honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
6600: gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
6601: the two trudged on together.
6602: 
6603: Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
6604: winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
6605: lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
6606: that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the
6607: second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
6608: himself into two.
6609: 
6610: The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
6611: under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low
6612: brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and
6613: wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
6614: the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
6615: Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
6616: Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
6617: defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
6618: He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
6619: third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
6620: there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
6621: and knees.
6622: 
6623: It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,
6624: holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
6625: in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
6626: and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
6627: that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
6628: tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
6629: creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
6630: fish.
6631: 
6632: They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
6633: appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
6634: Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
6635: striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
6636: with his hair as stiff as his father's.
6637: 
6638: But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
6639: only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
6640: were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
6641: the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
6642: screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
6643: strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
6644: earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
6645: it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
6646: wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he
6647: made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.
6648: 
6649: He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
6650: it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
6651: to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
6652: was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
6653: upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
6654: and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to
6655: shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
6656: was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
6657: roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
6658: like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
6659: too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
6660: to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
6661: and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was
6662: incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
6663: got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then
6664: it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
6665: stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
6666: his breast when he fell asleep.
6667: 
6668: From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
6669: daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
6670: family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
6671: inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
6672: ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the
6673: bed.
6674: 
6675: "I told you I would," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."
6676: 
6677: "Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife implored.
6678: 
6679: "You oppose yourself to the profit of the business," said Jerry, "and me
6680: and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't
6681: you?"
6682: 
6683: "I try to be a good wife, Jerry," the poor woman protested, with tears.
6684: 
6685: "Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it
6686: honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
6687: husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?"
6688: 
6689: "You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry."
6690: 
6691: "It's enough for you," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "to be the wife of a
6692: honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
6693: when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying
6694: wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
6695: woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have
6696: no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
6697: of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you."
6698: 
6699: The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
6700: the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
6701: at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on
6702: his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
6703: down too, and fell asleep again.
6704: 
6705: There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
6706: Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
6707: by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
6708: he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
6709: and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
6710: ostensible calling.
6711: 
6712: Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side
6713: along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
6714: from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and
6715: solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
6716: and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
6717: improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
6718: that fine morning.
6719: 
6720: "Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
6721: at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: "what's a
6722: Resurrection-Man?"
6723: 
6724: Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, "How
6725: should I know?"
6726: 
6727: "I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.
6728: 
6729: "Hem! Well," returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
6730: hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a tradesman."
6731: 
6732: "What's his goods, father?" asked the brisk Young Jerry.
6733: 
6734: "His goods," said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, "is a
6735: branch of Scientific goods."
6736: 
6737: "Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?" asked the lively boy.
6738: 
6739: "I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr. Cruncher.
6740: 
6741: "Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite
6742: growed up!"
6743: 
6744: Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
6745: "It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
6746: your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
6747: there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
6748: for." As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
6749: to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
6750: himself: "Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will
6751: yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!"
6752: 
6753: 
6754: 
6755: 
6756: XV. Knitting
6757: 
6758: 
6759: There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
6760: Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
6761: through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
6762: measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
6763: of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
6764: he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
6765: influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
6766: vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
6767: Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
6768: the dregs of it.
6769: 
6770: This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
6771: early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
6772: on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
6773: brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
6774: slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
6775: not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These
6776: were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
6777: have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
6778: and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
6779: looks.
6780: 
6781: Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
6782: was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
6783: threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
6784: only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
6785: wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
6786: and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
6787: humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
6788: 
6789: A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
6790: observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
6791: at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's
6792: gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
6793: towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
6794: of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
6795: with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
6796: a long way off.
6797: 
6798: Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was
6799: high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
6800: his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
6801: mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered
6802: the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
6803: of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
6804: flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
6805: followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
6806: the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
6807: 
6808: "Good day, gentlemen!" said Monsieur Defarge.
6809: 
6810: It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
6811: an answering chorus of "Good day!"
6812: 
6813: "It is bad weather, gentlemen," said Defarge, shaking his head.
6814: 
6815: Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
6816: their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.
6817: 
6818: "My wife," said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: "I have
6819: travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
6820: Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris.
6821: He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
6822: drink, my wife!"
6823: 
6824: A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the
6825: mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
6826: and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
6827: bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
6828: Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out.
6829: 
6830: Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
6831: than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
6832: rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
6833: He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
6834: Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.
6835: 
6836: "Have you finished your repast, friend?" he asked, in due season.
6837: 
6838: "Yes, thank you."
6839: 
6840: "Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
6841: occupy. It will suit you to a marvel."
6842: 
6843: Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
6844: courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
6845: staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
6846: sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
6847: 
6848: No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
6849: gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
6850: man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
6851: him through the chinks in the wall.
6852: 
6853: Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:
6854: 
6855: "Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
6856: encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
6857: Speak, Jacques Five!"
6858: 
6859: The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
6860: it, and said, "Where shall I commence, monsieur?"
6861: 
6862: "Commence," was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, "at the
6863: commencement."
6864: 
6865: "I saw him then, messieurs," began the mender of roads, "a year ago this
6866: running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
6867: chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
6868: going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
6869: hanging by the chain--like this."
6870: 
6871: Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
6872: he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
6873: the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
6874: during a whole year.
6875: 
6876: Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?
6877: 
6878: "Never," answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.
6879: 
6880: Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
6881: 
6882: "By his tall figure," said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
6883: finger at his nose. "When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
6884: 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre.'"
6885: 
6886: "You should have said, short as a dwarf," returned Jacques Two.
6887: 
6888: "But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
6889: confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
6890: offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,
6891: standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!'
6892: My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."
6893: 
6894: "He is right there, Jacques," murmured Defarge, to him who had
6895: interrupted. "Go on!"
6896: 
6897: "Good!" said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. "The tall man
6898: is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?"
6899: 
6900: "No matter, the number," said Defarge. "He is well hidden, but at last
6901: he is unluckily found. Go on!"
6902: 
6903: "I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
6904: go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
6905: village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
6906: coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
6907: with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!"
6908: 
6909: With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
6910: elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.
6911: 
6912: "I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
6913: and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
6914: spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
6915: see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
6916: that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
6917: going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
6918: their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
6919: road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
6920: Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
6921: with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
6922: to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would
6923: be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
6924: on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!"
6925: 
6926: He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
6927: vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
6928: 
6929: "I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
6930: show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
6931: our eyes. 'Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the
6932: village, 'bring him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster. I
6933: follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
6934: shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and
6935: consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!"
6936: 
6937: He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the
6938: butt-ends of muskets.
6939: 
6940: "As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
6941: laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
6942: but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into
6943: the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,
6944: and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
6945: darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!"
6946: 
6947: He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
6948: snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
6949: opening it again, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."
6950: 
6951: "All the village," pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
6952: voice, "withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
6953: village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
6954: locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
6955: except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
6956: my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
6957: my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
6958: iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no
6959: hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
6960: dead man."
6961: 
6962: Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
6963: of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
6964: countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
6965: authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
6966: and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
6967: his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
6968: intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
6969: over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
6970: standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the
6971: light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
6972: him.
6973: 
6974: "Go on, Jacques," said Defarge.
6975: 
6976: "He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
6977: at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a
6978: distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
6979: of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
6980: faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
6981: the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They
6982: whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
6983: executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
6984: that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
6985: that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
6986: It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no."
6987: 
6988: "Listen then, Jacques," Number One of that name sternly interposed.
6989: "Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
6990: yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,
6991: sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
6992: hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
6993: his hand."
6994: 
6995: "And once again listen, Jacques!" said the kneeling Number Three:
6996: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
6997: strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
6998: food nor drink; "the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
6999: and struck him blows. You hear?"
7000: 
7001: "I hear, messieurs."
7002: 
7003: "Go on then," said Defarge.
7004: 
7005: "Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain," resumed the
7006: countryman, "that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
7007: the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
7008: that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
7009: father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
7010: parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed
7011: with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
7012: which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
7013: poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
7014: that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
7015: says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
7016: the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?
7017: I am not a scholar."
7018: 
7019: "Listen once again then, Jacques!" said the man with the restless hand
7020: and the craving air. "The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
7021: all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
7022: nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
7023: the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
7024: attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
7025: when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
7026: done--why, how old are you?"
7027: 
7028: "Thirty-five," said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
7029: 
7030: "It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
7031: it."
7032: 
7033: "Enough!" said Defarge, with grim impatience. "Long live the Devil! Go
7034: on."
7035: 
7036: "Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
7037: even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
7038: night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
7039: the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
7040: Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
7041: the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
7042: water."
7043: 
7044: The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
7045: and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
7046: 
7047: "All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
7048: the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
7049: have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst
7050: of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
7051: a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
7052: laughed." He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
7053: from the corners of his mouth to his ears. "On the top of the gallows is
7054: fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged
7055: there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water."
7056: 
7057: They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
7058: on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
7059: spectacle.
7060: 
7061: "It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
7062: water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
7063: I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
7064: bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
7065: across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
7066: messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!"
7067: 
7068: The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
7069: three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.
7070: 
7071: "That's all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
7072: and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
7073: warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now
7074: walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
7075: you see me!"
7076: 
7077: After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, "Good! You have acted
7078: and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
7079: door?"
7080: 
7081: "Very willingly," said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
7082: top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.
7083: 
7084: The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
7085: the garret.
7086: 
7087: "How say you, Jacques?" demanded Number One. "To be registered?"
7088: 
7089: "To be registered, as doomed to destruction," returned Defarge.
7090: 
7091: "Magnificent!" croaked the man with the craving.
7092: 
7093: "The chateau, and all the race?" inquired the first.
7094: 
7095: "The chateau and all the race," returned Defarge. "Extermination."
7096: 
7097: The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, "Magnificent!" and began
7098: gnawing another finger.
7099: 
7100: "Are you sure," asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, "that no embarrassment
7101: can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
7102: safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
7103: be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?"
7104: 
7105: "Jacques," returned Defarge, drawing himself up, "if madame my wife
7106: undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
7107: a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her
7108: own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
7109: Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
7110: to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
7111: crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge."
7112: 
7113: There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
7114: hungered, asked: "Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is
7115: very simple; is he not a little dangerous?"
7116: 
7117: "He knows nothing," said Defarge; "at least nothing more than would
7118: easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
7119: with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
7120: on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
7121: Court; let him see them on Sunday."
7122: 
7123: "What?" exclaimed the hungry man, staring. "Is it a good sign, that he
7124: wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?"
7125: 
7126: "Jacques," said Defarge; "judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
7127: to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
7128: him to bring it down one day."
7129: 
7130: Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
7131: dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
7132: pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon
7133: asleep.
7134: 
7135: Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
7136: in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
7137: dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
7138: new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
7139: unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
7140: his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
7141: he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he
7142: contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
7143: might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
7144: into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
7145: murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
7146: with it until the play was played out.
7147: 
7148: Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
7149: (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
7150: and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
7151: madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
7152: additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
7153: afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
7154: see the carriage of the King and Queen.
7155: 
7156: "You work hard, madame," said a man near her.
7157: 
7158: "Yes," answered Madame Defarge; "I have a good deal to do."
7159: 
7160: "What do you make, madame?"
7161: 
7162: "Many things."
7163: 
7164: "For instance--"
7165: 
7166: "For instance," returned Madame Defarge, composedly, "shrouds."
7167: 
7168: The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
7169: of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
7170: and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
7171: fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
7172: and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
7173: shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
7174: ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
7175: and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
7176: sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
7177: intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
7178: Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of
7179: ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
7180: terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,
7181: more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept
7182: with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
7183: hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
7184: and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
7185: from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
7186: pieces.
7187: 
7188: "Bravo!" said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a
7189: patron; "you are a good boy!"
7190: 
7191: The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
7192: having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.
7193: 
7194: "You are the fellow we want," said Defarge, in his ear; "you make
7195: these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
7196: insolent, and it is the nearer ended."
7197: 
7198: "Hey!" cried the mender of roads, reflectively; "that's true."
7199: 
7200: "These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
7201: stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
7202: in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
7203: tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
7204: deceive them too much."
7205: 
7206: Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
7207: confirmation.
7208: 
7209: "As to you," said she, "you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
7210: it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?"
7211: 
7212: "Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment."
7213: 
7214: "If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
7215: pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
7216: pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?"
7217: 
7218: "Truly yes, madame."
7219: 
7220: "Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
7221: set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
7222: you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?"
7223: 
7224: "It is true, madame."
7225: 
7226: "You have seen both dolls and birds to-day," said Madame Defarge, with
7227: a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
7228: "now, go home!"
7229: 
7230: 
7231: 
7232: 
7233: XVI. Still Knitting
7234: 
7235: 
7236: Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
7237: bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
7238: darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
7239: the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
7240: the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
7241: the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
7242: for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
7243: scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
7244: stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
7245: terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
7246: the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
7247: village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
7248: when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
7249: faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
7250: up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
7251: look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the
7252: stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
7253: was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
7254: everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
7255: scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
7256: crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
7257: skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
7258: started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
7259: who could find a living there.
7260: 
7261: Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
7262: stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
7263: of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
7264: night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
7265: world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
7266: star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
7267: the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
7268: the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
7269: vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
7270: 
7271: The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
7272: in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
7273: journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier
7274: guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
7275: examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
7276: of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate
7277: with, and affectionately embraced.
7278: 
7279: When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,
7280: and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were
7281: picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
7282: streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:
7283: 
7284: "Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?"
7285: 
7286: "Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy
7287: commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he
7288: can say, but he knows of one."
7289: 
7290: "Eh well!" said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
7291: business air. "It is necessary to register him. How do they call that
7292: man?"
7293: 
7294: "He is English."
7295: 
7296: "So much the better. His name?"
7297: 
7298: "Barsad," said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had
7299: been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
7300: correctness.
7301: 
7302: "Barsad," repeated madame. "Good. Christian name?"
7303: 
7304: "John."
7305: 
7306: "John Barsad," repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
7307: "Good. His appearance; is it known?"
7308: 
7309: "Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
7310: complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
7311: thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
7312: peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
7313: sinister."
7314: 
7315: "Eh my faith. It is a portrait!" said madame, laughing. "He shall be
7316: registered to-morrow."
7317: 
7318: They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
7319: and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
7320: the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the
7321: stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
7322: her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
7323: dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl
7324: of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
7325: handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
7326: night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
7327: up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
7328: condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
7329: walked up and down through life.
7330: 
7331: The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
7332: neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was
7333: by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
7334: it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He
7335: whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.
7336: 
7337: "You are fatigued," said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
7338: money. "There are only the usual odours."
7339: 
7340: "I am a little tired," her husband acknowledged.
7341: 
7342: "You are a little depressed, too," said madame, whose quick eyes had
7343: never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for
7344: him. "Oh, the men, the men!"
7345: 
7346: "But my dear!" began Defarge.
7347: 
7348: "But my dear!" repeated madame, nodding firmly; "but my dear! You are
7349: faint of heart to-night, my dear!"
7350: 
7351: "Well, then," said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
7352: breast, "it _is_ a long time."
7353: 
7354: "It is a long time," repeated his wife; "and when is it not a long time?
7355: Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule."
7356: 
7357: "It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning," said
7358: Defarge.
7359: 
7360: "How long," demanded madame, composedly, "does it take to make and store
7361: the lightning? Tell me."
7362: 
7363: Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
7364: too.
7365: 
7366: "It does not take a long time," said madame, "for an earthquake to
7367: swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
7368: earthquake?"
7369: 
7370: "A long time, I suppose," said Defarge.
7371: 
7372: "But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
7373: before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
7374: seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it."
7375: 
7376: She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.
7377: 
7378: "I tell thee," said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
7379: "that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and
7380: coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it
7381: is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world
7382: that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider
7383: the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with
7384: more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
7385: you."
7386: 
7387: "My brave wife," returned Defarge, standing before her with his head
7388: a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
7389: attentive pupil before his catechist, "I do not question all this. But
7390: it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
7391: it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives."
7392: 
7393: "Eh well! How then?" demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
7394: were another enemy strangled.
7395: 
7396: "Well!" said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
7397: "We shall not see the triumph."
7398: 
7399: "We shall have helped it," returned madame, with her extended hand in
7400: strong action. "Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all
7401: my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew
7402: certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
7403: would--"
7404: 
7405: Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.
7406: 
7407: "Hold!" cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
7408: cowardice; "I too, my dear, will stop at nothing."
7409: 
7410: "Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
7411: and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.
7412: When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the
7413: time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready."
7414: 
7415: Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
7416: little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
7417: out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
7418: manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
7419: 
7420: Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
7421: wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
7422: now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
7423: usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
7424: drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
7425: and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
7426: perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
7427: dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
7428: out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
7429: themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
7430: the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
7431: thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.
7432: 
7433: A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she
7434: felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
7435: rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.
7436: 
7437: It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
7438: customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
7439: wine-shop.
7440: 
7441: "Good day, madame," said the new-comer.
7442: 
7443: "Good day, monsieur."
7444: 
7445: She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
7446: "Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
7447: hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
7448: thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
7449: peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
7450: expression! Good day, one and all!"
7451: 
7452: "Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
7453: mouthful of cool fresh water, madame."
7454: 
7455: Madame complied with a polite air.
7456: 
7457: "Marvellous cognac this, madame!"
7458: 
7459: It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
7460: Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,
7461: however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The
7462: visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
7463: of observing the place in general.
7464: 
7465: "You knit with great skill, madame."
7466: 
7467: "I am accustomed to it."
7468: 
7469: "A pretty pattern too!"
7470: 
7471: "_You_ think so?" said madame, looking at him with a smile.
7472: 
7473: "Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?"
7474: 
7475: "Pastime," said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
7476: fingers moved nimbly.
7477: 
7478: "Not for use?"
7479: 
7480: "That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well," said
7481: madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
7482: coquetry, "I'll use it!"
7483: 
7484: It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
7485: decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
7486: men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
7487: catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
7488: looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
7489: Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
7490: one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,
7491: but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a
7492: poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
7493: unimpeachable.
7494: 
7495: "_John_," thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,
7496: and her eyes looked at the stranger. "Stay long enough, and I shall knit
7497: 'BARSAD' before you go."
7498: 
7499: "You have a husband, madame?"
7500: 
7501: "I have."
7502: 
7503: "Children?"
7504: 
7505: "No children."
7506: 
7507: "Business seems bad?"
7508: 
7509: "Business is very bad; the people are so poor."
7510: 
7511: "Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say."
7512: 
7513: "As _you_ say," madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an
7514: extra something into his name that boded him no good.
7515: 
7516: "Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
7517: Of course."
7518: 
7519: "_I_ think?" returned madame, in a high voice. "I and my husband have
7520: enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we
7521: think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and
7522: it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
7523: embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no."
7524: 
7525: The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did
7526: not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
7527: stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
7528: Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.
7529: 
7530: "A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor
7531: Gaspard!" With a sigh of great compassion.
7532: 
7533: "My faith!" returned madame, coolly and lightly, "if people use knives
7534: for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the
7535: price of his luxury was; he has paid the price."
7536: 
7537: "I believe," said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone
7538: that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
7539: susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: "I believe there
7540: is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
7541: fellow? Between ourselves."
7542: 
7543: "Is there?" asked madame, vacantly.
7544: 
7545: "Is there not?"
7546: 
7547: "--Here is my husband!" said Madame Defarge.
7548: 
7549: As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
7550: him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, "Good day,
7551: Jacques!" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.
7552: 
7553: "Good day, Jacques!" the spy repeated; with not quite so much
7554: confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.
7555: 
7556: "You deceive yourself, monsieur," returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
7557: "You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge."
7558: 
7559: "It is all the same," said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: "good
7560: day!"
7561: 
7562: "Good day!" answered Defarge, drily.
7563: 
7564: "I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when
7565: you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
7566: and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard."
7567: 
7568: "No one has told me so," said Defarge, shaking his head. "I know nothing
7569: of it."
7570: 
7571: Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his
7572: hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the
7573: person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
7574: have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
7575: 
7576: The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
7577: attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
7578: water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it
7579: out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
7580: it.
7581: 
7582: "You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?"
7583: observed Defarge.
7584: 
7585: "Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested
7586: in its miserable inhabitants."
7587: 
7588: "Hah!" muttered Defarge.
7589: 
7590: "The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,"
7591: pursued the spy, "that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
7592: associations with your name."
7593: 
7594: "Indeed!" said Defarge, with much indifference.
7595: 
7596: "Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
7597: had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am
7598: informed of the circumstances?"
7599: 
7600: "Such is the fact, certainly," said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
7601: to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and
7602: warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.
7603: 
7604: "It was to you," said the spy, "that his daughter came; and it was
7605: from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown
7606: monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
7607: Tellson and Company--over to England."
7608: 
7609: "Such is the fact," repeated Defarge.
7610: 
7611: "Very interesting remembrances!" said the spy. "I have known Doctor
7612: Manette and his daughter, in England."
7613: 
7614: "Yes?" said Defarge.
7615: 
7616: "You don't hear much about them now?" said the spy.
7617: 
7618: "No," said Defarge.
7619: 
7620: "In effect," madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little
7621: song, "we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe
7622: arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
7623: they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
7624: no correspondence."
7625: 
7626: "Perfectly so, madame," replied the spy. "She is going to be married."
7627: 
7628: "Going?" echoed madame. "She was pretty enough to have been married long
7629: ago. You English are cold, it seems to me."
7630: 
7631: "Oh! You know I am English."
7632: 
7633: "I perceive your tongue is," returned madame; "and what the tongue is, I
7634: suppose the man is."
7635: 
7636: He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best
7637: of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the
7638: end, he added:
7639: 
7640: "Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to
7641: one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,
7642: poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is
7643: going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
7644: was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
7645: Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is
7646: Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family."
7647: 
7648: Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
7649: effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,
7650: as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
7651: troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no
7652: spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.
7653: 
7654: Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
7655: worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
7656: paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,
7657: in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
7658: pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes
7659: after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
7660: husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
7661: come back.
7662: 
7663: "Can it be true," said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
7664: as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: "what he has
7665: said of Ma'amselle Manette?"
7666: 
7667: "As he has said it," returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, "it
7668: is probably false. But it may be true."
7669: 
7670: "If it is--" Defarge began, and stopped.
7671: 
7672: "If it is?" repeated his wife.
7673: 
7674: "--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her
7675: sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France."
7676: 
7677: "Her husband's destiny," said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,
7678: "will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is
7679: to end him. That is all I know."
7680: 
7681: "But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange"--said
7682: Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
7683: "that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her
7684: husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
7685: the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?"
7686: 
7687: "Stranger things than that will happen when it does come," answered
7688: madame. "I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
7689: for their merits; that is enough."
7690: 
7691: She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently
7692: took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.
7693: Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
7694: decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
7695: disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
7696: shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.
7697: 
7698: In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
7699: himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
7700: to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
7701: Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
7702: to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like
7703: her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
7704: knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
7705: mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
7706: jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
7707: the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.
7708: 
7709: But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame
7710: Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
7711: among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left
7712: behind.
7713: 
7714: Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. "A
7715: great woman," said he, "a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully
7716: grand woman!"
7717: 
7718: Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and
7719: the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as
7720: the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another
7721: darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing
7722: pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
7723: thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a
7724: wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,
7725: Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat
7726: knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
7727: a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
7728: counting dropping heads.
7729: 
7730: 
7731: 
7732: 
7733: XVII. One Night
7734: 
7735: 
7736: Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
7737: Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat
7738: under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
7739: radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
7740: seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.
7741: 
7742: Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening
7743: for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.
7744: 
7745: "You are happy, my dear father?"
7746: 
7747: "Quite, my child."
7748: 
7749: They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
7750: was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
7751: in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
7752: both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
7753: time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.
7754: 
7755: "And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the
7756: love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love
7757: for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
7758: if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
7759: the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and
7760: self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--"
7761: 
7762: Even as it was, she could not command her voice.
7763: 
7764: In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
7765: upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
7766: the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and
7767: its going.
7768: 
7769: "Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
7770: quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
7771: ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your
7772: own heart, do you feel quite certain?"
7773: 
7774: Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
7775: scarcely have assumed, "Quite sure, my darling! More than that," he
7776: added, as he tenderly kissed her: "my future is far brighter, Lucie,
7777: seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
7778: was--without it."
7779: 
7780: "If I could hope _that_, my father!--"
7781: 
7782: "Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain
7783: it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot
7784: fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
7785: wasted--"
7786: 
7787: She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated
7788: the word.
7789: 
7790: "--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
7791: natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
7792: comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
7793: how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?"
7794: 
7795: "If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
7796: with you."
7797: 
7798: He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
7799: without Charles, having seen him; and replied:
7800: 
7801: "My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
7802: Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
7803: should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have
7804: cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you."
7805: 
7806: It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
7807: refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new
7808: sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
7809: afterwards.
7810: 
7811: "See!" said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.
7812: "I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
7813: light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
7814: of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
7815: my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
7816: that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
7817: could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
7818: with which I could intersect them." He added in his inward and pondering
7819: manner, as he looked at the moon, "It was twenty either way, I remember,
7820: and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in."
7821: 
7822: The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
7823: deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
7824: the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
7825: cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
7826: 
7827: "I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
7828: child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had
7829: been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it
7830: was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my
7831: imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it
7832: was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live
7833: to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own
7834: will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman."
7835: 
7836: She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.
7837: 
7838: "I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
7839: me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
7840: cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married
7841: to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
7842: the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a
7843: blank."
7844: 
7845: "My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
7846: never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child."
7847: 
7848: "You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
7849: brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
7850: the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?"
7851: 
7852: "She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you."
7853: 
7854: "So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
7855: have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
7856: like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
7857: foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
7858: leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her
7859: image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
7860: her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.
7861: But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?"
7862: 
7863: "The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?"
7864: 
7865: "No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of
7866: sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another
7867: and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than
7868: that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you
7869: have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?
7870: I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
7871: perplexed distinctions."
7872: 
7873: His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
7874: cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.
7875: 
7876: "In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
7877: coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
7878: life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture
7879: was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
7880: cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all."
7881: 
7882: "I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
7883: that was I."
7884: 
7885: "And she showed me her children," said the Doctor of Beauvais, "and
7886: they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed
7887: a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
7888: up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I
7889: imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.
7890: But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
7891: blessed her."
7892: 
7893: "I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless
7894: me as fervently to-morrow?"
7895: 
7896: "Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
7897: for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
7898: happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the
7899: happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us."
7900: 
7901: He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked
7902: Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the
7903: house.
7904: 
7905: There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
7906: be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no
7907: change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
7908: by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
7909: apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
7910: 
7911: Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only
7912: three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles
7913: was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
7914: little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.
7915: 
7916: So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
7917: But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
7918: downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
7919: beforehand.
7920: 
7921: All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
7922: asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
7923: hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
7924: shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;
7925: then, leaned over him, and looked at him.
7926: 
7927: Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he
7928: covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the
7929: mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,
7930: resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
7931: beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.
7932: 
7933: She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that
7934: she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his
7935: sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once
7936: more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
7937: of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
7938: in praying for him.
7939: 
7940: 
7941: 
7942: 
7943: XVIII. Nine Days
7944: 
7945: 
7946: The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
7947: closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles
7948: Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.
7949: Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
7950: reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
7951: but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should
7952: have been the bridegroom.
7953: 
7954: "And so," said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
7955: and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
7956: pretty dress; "and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
7957: you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought
7958: what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring
7959: on my friend Mr. Charles!"
7960: 
7961: "You didn't mean it," remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, "and
7962: therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!"
7963: 
7964: "Really? Well; but don't cry," said the gentle Mr. Lorry.
7965: 
7966: "I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "_you_ are."
7967: 
7968: "I, my Pross?" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,
7969: on occasion.)
7970: 
7971: "You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such
7972: a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into
7973: anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection," said
7974: Miss Pross, "that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till
7975: I couldn't see it."
7976: 
7977: "I am highly gratified," said Mr. Lorry, "though, upon my honour, I
7978: had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
7979: invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
7980: speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there
7981: might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!"
7982: 
7983: "Not at all!" From Miss Pross.
7984: 
7985: "You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?" asked the
7986: gentleman of that name.
7987: 
7988: "Pooh!" rejoined Miss Pross; "you were a bachelor in your cradle."
7989: 
7990: "Well!" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, "that
7991: seems probable, too."
7992: 
7993: "And you were cut out for a bachelor," pursued Miss Pross, "before you
7994: were put in your cradle."
7995: 
7996: "Then, I think," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was very unhandsomely dealt
7997: with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
7998: pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round
7999: her waist, "I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and
8000: I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
8001: opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave
8002: your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
8003: own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
8004: fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's
8005: shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
8006: the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
8007: your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
8008: him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
8009: Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
8010: old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
8011: own."
8012: 
8013: For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the
8014: well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
8015: golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
8016: delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.
8017: 
8018: The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles
8019: Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
8020: went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.
8021: But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
8022: shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
8023: old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
8024: wind.
8025: 
8026: He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
8027: which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in
8028: another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
8029: eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.
8030: 
8031: Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
8032: group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
8033: glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the
8034: dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to
8035: breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
8036: mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were
8037: mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the
8038: door at parting.
8039: 
8040: It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
8041: cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
8042: enfolding arms, "Take her, Charles! She is yours!"
8043: 
8044: And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
8045: gone.
8046: 
8047: The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
8048: preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
8049: and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
8050: the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
8051: change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
8052: there, had struck him a poisoned blow.
8053: 
8054: He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
8055: expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was
8056: the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent
8057: manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
8058: room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
8059: wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.
8060: 
8061: "I think," he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, "I
8062: think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
8063: I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back
8064: presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine
8065: there, and all will be well."
8066: 
8067: It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of
8068: Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the
8069: old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
8070: into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.
8071: 
8072: "Good God!" he said, with a start. "What's that?"
8073: 
8074: Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. "O me, O me! All is
8075: lost!" cried she, wringing her hands. "What is to be told to Ladybird?
8076: He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!"
8077: 
8078: Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
8079: Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
8080: when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
8081: down, and he was very busy.
8082: 
8083: "Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!"
8084: 
8085: The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
8086: were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.
8087: 
8088: He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
8089: throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
8090: haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked
8091: hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.
8092: 
8093: Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a
8094: shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
8095: him, and asked what it was.
8096: 
8097: "A young lady's walking shoe," he muttered, without looking up. "It
8098: ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be."
8099: 
8100: "But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!"
8101: 
8102: He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
8103: his work.
8104: 
8105: "You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper
8106: occupation. Think, dear friend!"
8107: 
8108: Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at
8109: a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
8110: a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
8111: words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
8112: the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
8113: he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there
8114: seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
8115: trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.
8116: 
8117: Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
8118: all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
8119: the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In
8120: conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
8121: precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a
8122: few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised
8123: on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been
8124: called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
8125: two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
8126: addressed to her by the same post.
8127: 
8128: These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
8129: the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
8130: another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
8131: thought the best, on the Doctor's case.
8132: 
8133: In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course
8134: being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him
8135: attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He
8136: therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the
8137: first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same
8138: room.
8139: 
8140: He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
8141: to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that
8142: attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
8143: before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
8144: fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
8145: window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
8146: natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.
8147: 
8148: Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
8149: that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
8150: after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
8151: When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
8152: and said to him:
8153: 
8154: "Will you go out?"
8155: 
8156: He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
8157: looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:
8158: 
8159: "Out?"
8160: 
8161: "Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"
8162: 
8163: He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.
8164: Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,
8165: with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
8166: some misty way asking himself, "Why not?" The sagacity of the man of
8167: business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.
8168: 
8169: Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
8170: at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long
8171: time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
8172: fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
8173: bench and to work.
8174: 
8175: On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
8176: and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He
8177: returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
8178: that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry
8179: to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;
8180: at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
8181: present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
8182: amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
8183: enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's
8184: friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
8185: appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
8186: him.
8187: 
8188: When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:
8189: 
8190: "Dear Doctor, will you go out?"
8191: 
8192: As before, he repeated, "Out?"
8193: 
8194: "Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"
8195: 
8196: This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
8197: from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the
8198: meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had
8199: sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he
8200: slipped away to his bench.
8201: 
8202: The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his
8203: heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
8204: The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,
8205: seven days, eight days, nine days.
8206: 
8207: With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and
8208: heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was
8209: well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to
8210: observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
8211: was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on
8212: his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
8213: the dusk of the ninth evening.
8214: 
8215: 
8216: 
8217: 
8218: XIX. An Opinion
8219: 
8220: 
8221: Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
8222: tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
8223: into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
8224: night.
8225: 
8226: He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had
8227: done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the
8228: Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench
8229: and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading
8230: at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which
8231: Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
8232: studious and attentive.
8233: 
8234: Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
8235: giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
8236: not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his
8237: friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
8238: as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
8239: which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?
8240: 
8241: It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
8242: answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
8243: corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
8244: How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
8245: Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
8246: Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?
8247: 
8248: Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he
8249: had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
8250: resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
8251: He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
8252: breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
8253: had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.
8254: Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
8255: the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.
8256: 
8257: Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked
8258: out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical
8259: toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
8260: white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the
8261: usual way, and came to breakfast.
8262: 
8263: So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
8264: delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe
8265: advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken
8266: place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
8267: the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
8268: counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
8269: he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid
8270: he sought. And that aid was his own.
8271: 
8272: Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the
8273: Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:
8274: 
8275: "My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
8276: very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
8277: very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
8278: so."
8279: 
8280: Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the
8281: Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced
8282: at his hands more than once.
8283: 
8284: "Doctor Manette," said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the
8285: arm, "the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
8286: give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
8287: for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette."
8288: 
8289: "If I understand," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, "some mental
8290: shock--?"
8291: 
8292: "Yes!"
8293: 
8294: "Be explicit," said the Doctor. "Spare no detail."
8295: 
8296: Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
8297: 
8298: "My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,
8299: of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,
8300: the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a
8301: shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
8302: long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there
8303: are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from
8304: which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace
8305: himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is
8306: the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to
8307: be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
8308: great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his
8309: stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,
8310: there has been," he paused and took a deep breath--"a slight relapse."
8311: 
8312: The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, "Of how long duration?"
8313: 
8314: "Nine days and nights."
8315: 
8316: "How did it show itself? I infer," glancing at his hands again, "in the
8317: resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?"
8318: 
8319: "That is the fact."
8320: 
8321: "Now, did you ever see him," asked the Doctor, distinctly and
8322: collectedly, though in the same low voice, "engaged in that pursuit
8323: originally?"
8324: 
8325: "Once."
8326: 
8327: "And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
8328: respects--as he was then?"
8329: 
8330: "I think in all respects."
8331: 
8332: "You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?"
8333: 
8334: "No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.
8335: It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted."
8336: 
8337: The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, "That was very kind. That was
8338: very thoughtful!" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of
8339: the two spoke for a little while.
8340: 
8341: "Now, my dear Manette," said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
8342: considerate and most affectionate way, "I am a mere man of business,
8343: and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
8344: possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
8345: intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
8346: I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
8347: relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it
8348: be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come
8349: about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been
8350: more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
8351: if I knew how.
8352: 
8353: "But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
8354: knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
8355: able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
8356: Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
8357: and teach me how to be a little more useful."
8358: 
8359: Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
8360: Mr. Lorry did not press him.
8361: 
8362: "I think it probable," said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
8363: "that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
8364: unforeseen by its subject."
8365: 
8366: "Was it dreaded by him?" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.
8367: 
8368: "Very much." He said it with an involuntary shudder.
8369: 
8370: "You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's
8371: mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force
8372: himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him."
8373: 
8374: "Would he," asked Mr. Lorry, "be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
8375: upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
8376: him?"
8377: 
8378: "I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
8379: believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible."
8380: 
8381: "Now," said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again,
8382: after a short silence on both sides, "to what would you refer this
8383: attack?"
8384: 
8385: "I believe," returned Doctor Manette, "that there had been a strong and
8386: extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
8387: was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
8388: distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that
8389: there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
8390: would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
8391: particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
8392: effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it."
8393: 
8394: "Would he remember what took place in the relapse?" asked Mr. Lorry,
8395: with natural hesitation.
8396: 
8397: The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
8398: answered, in a low voice, "Not at all."
8399: 
8400: "Now, as to the future," hinted Mr. Lorry.
8401: 
8402: "As to the future," said the Doctor, recovering firmness, "I should have
8403: great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I
8404: should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated
8405: something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
8406: and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
8407: the worst was over."
8408: 
8409: "Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!" said Mr. Lorry.
8410: 
8411: "I am thankful!" repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.
8412: 
8413: "There are two other points," said Mr. Lorry, "on which I am anxious to
8414: be instructed. I may go on?"
8415: 
8416: "You cannot do your friend a better service." The Doctor gave him his
8417: hand.
8418: 
8419: "To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
8420: he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
8421: knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does
8422: he do too much?"
8423: 
8424: "I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
8425: singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in
8426: part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy
8427: things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
8428: direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery."
8429: 
8430: "You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?"
8431: 
8432: "I think I am quite sure of it."
8433: 
8434: "My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--"
8435: 
8436: "My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
8437: violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight."
8438: 
8439: "Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,
8440: that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
8441: disorder?"
8442: 
8443: "I do not think so. I do not think," said Doctor Manette with the
8444: firmness of self-conviction, "that anything but the one train of
8445: association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
8446: extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has
8447: happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
8448: such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost
8449: believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted."
8450: 
8451: He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
8452: would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
8453: confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
8454: endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that
8455: confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
8456: really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to
8457: be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning
8458: conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the
8459: last nine days, he knew that he must face it.
8460: 
8461: "The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
8462: so happily recovered from," said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, "we
8463: will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a
8464: case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
8465: time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
8466: found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by
8467: him?"
8468: 
8469: The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
8470: nervously on the ground.
8471: 
8472: "He has always kept it by him," said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
8473: his friend. "Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?"
8474: 
8475: Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the
8476: ground.
8477: 
8478: "You do not find it easy to advise me?" said Mr. Lorry. "I quite
8479: understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--" And there he
8480: shook his head, and stopped.
8481: 
8482: "You see," said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
8483: "it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
8484: of this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that
8485: occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
8486: his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
8487: the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
8488: practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
8489: torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
8490: quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of
8491: himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
8492: of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not
8493: find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
8494: fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child."
8495: 
8496: He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's
8497: face.
8498: 
8499: "But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
8500: who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
8501: bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
8502: the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go
8503: with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the
8504: forge?"
8505: 
8506: There was another silence.
8507: 
8508: "You see, too," said the Doctor, tremulously, "it is such an old
8509: companion."
8510: 
8511: "I would not keep it," said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained
8512: in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. "I would recommend him to
8513: sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.
8514: Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter's
8515: sake, my dear Manette!"
8516: 
8517: Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!
8518: 
8519: "In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take
8520: it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;
8521: let him miss his old companion after an absence."
8522: 
8523: Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They
8524: passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the
8525: three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
8526: day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that
8527: had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
8528: explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
8529: she had no suspicions.
8530: 
8531: On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into
8532: his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
8533: carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
8534: guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
8535: Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
8536: which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The
8537: burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
8538: purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
8539: shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction
8540: and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
8541: while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
8542: traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
8543: crime.
8544: 
8545: 
8546: 
8547: 
8548: XX. A Plea
8549: 
8550: 
8551: When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
8553: many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or
8554: in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
8555: about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.
8556: 
8557: He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
8558: speaking to him when no one overheard.
8559: 
8560: "Mr. Darnay," said Carton, "I wish we might be friends."
8561: 
8562: "We are already friends, I hope."
8563: 
8564: "You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't
8565: mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
8566: friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either."
8567: 
8568: Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
8569: good-fellowship, what he did mean?
8570: 
8571: "Upon my life," said Carton, smiling, "I find that easier to comprehend
8572: in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You
8573: remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
8574: usual?"
8575: 
8576: "I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
8577: you had been drinking."
8578: 
8579: "I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
8580: always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,
8581: when all days are at an end for me! Don't be alarmed; I am not going to
8582: preach."
8583: 
8584: "I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
8585: to me."
8586: 
8587: "Ah!" said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that
8588: away. "On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as
8589: you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
8590: wish you would forget it."
8591: 
8592: "I forgot it long ago."
8593: 
8594: "Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
8595: me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
8596: and a light answer does not help me to forget it."
8597: 
8598: "If it was a light answer," returned Darnay, "I beg your forgiveness
8599: for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
8600: surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
8601: faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
8602: Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to
8603: remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?"
8604: 
8605: "As to the great service," said Carton, "I am bound to avow to you, when
8606: you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
8607: don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I
8608: say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past."
8609: 
8610: "You make light of the obligation," returned Darnay, "but I will not
8611: quarrel with _your_ light answer."
8612: 
8613: "Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;
8614: I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am
8615: incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,
8616: ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so."
8617: 
8618: "I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his."
8619: 
8620: "Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done
8621: any good, and never will."
8622: 
8623: "I don't know that you 'never will.'"
8624: 
8625: "But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure
8626: to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
8627: reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
8628: permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
8629: be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the
8630: resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
8631: furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I
8632: doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I
8633: should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I
8634: dare say, to know that I had it."
8635: 
8636: "Will you try?"
8637: 
8638: "That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have
8639: indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?"
8640: 
8641: "I think so, Carton, by this time."
8642: 
8643: They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute
8644: afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.
8645: 
8646: When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
8647: Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
8649: problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
8650: bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
8651: him as he showed himself.
8652: 
8653: He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
8654: wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
8655: her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
8656: marked.
8657: 
8658: "We are thoughtful to-night!" said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.
8659: 
8660: "Yes, dearest Charles," with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring
8661: and attentive expression fixed upon him; "we are rather thoughtful
8662: to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night."
8663: 
8664: "What is it, my Lucie?"
8665: 
8666: "Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
8667: ask it?"
8668: 
8669: "Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?"
8670: 
8671: What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
8672: cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
8673: 
8674: "I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
8675: respect than you expressed for him to-night."
8676: 
8677: "Indeed, my own? Why so?"
8678: 
8679: "That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does."
8680: 
8681: "If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?"
8682: 
8683: "I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
8684: lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that
8685: he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
8686: wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding."
8687: 
8688: "It is a painful reflection to me," said Charles Darnay, quite
8689: astounded, "that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this
8690: of him."
8691: 
8692: "My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
8693: scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
8694: now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
8695: even magnanimous things."
8696: 
8697: She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
8698: that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.
8699: 
8700: "And, O my dearest Love!" she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her
8701: head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, "remember how strong
8702: we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!"
8703: 
8704: The supplication touched him home. "I will always remember it, dear
8705: Heart! I will remember it as long as I live."
8706: 
8707: He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded
8708: her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
8709: could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops
8710: of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
8711: that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not
8712: have parted from his lips for the first time--
8713: 
8714: "God bless her for her sweet compassion!"
8715: 
8716: 
8717: 
8718: 
8719: XXI. Echoing Footsteps
8720: 
8721: 
8722: A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
8723: the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
8724: her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
8725: companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
8726: the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
8727: years.
8728: 
8729: At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
8730: when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
8731: dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
8732: afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
8733: Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
8734: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
8735: her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
8736: footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
8737: be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
8738: eyes, and broke like waves.
8739: 
8740: That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the
8741: advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
8742: her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
8743: mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and
8744: the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of
8745: children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
8746: her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
8747: joy to her.
8748: 
8749: Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
8750: weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
8751: their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
8752: echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband's
8753: step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal.
8754: Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
8755: unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
8756: plane-tree in the garden!
8757: 
8758: Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
8759: harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a
8760: pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
8761: smile, "Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
8762: leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!" those were not
8763: tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit
8764: departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and
8765: forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words!
8766: 
8767: Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other
8768: echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
8769: of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
8770: mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed
8771: murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
8772: the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
8773: dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of
8774: the Two Cities that were blended in her life.
8775: 
8777: half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
8778: uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
8779: done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing
8780: regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
8781: all true echoes for ages and ages.
8782: 
8783: No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a
8784: blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,
8785: but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive
8786: delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
8787: such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
8788: was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,
8789: and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of
8790: him, almost at the last. "Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!"
8791: 
8792: Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine
8793: forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
8794: his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
8795: in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
8796: life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
8797: stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
8798: it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
8799: state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
8800: rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
8801: property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
8802: but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
8803: 
8804: These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
8805: offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
8806: sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
8807: Lucie's husband: delicately saying "Halloa! here are three lumps of
8808: bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!" The polite
8809: rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
8810: Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
8811: training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
8812: pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
8813: declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts
8814: Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to "catch" him, and on the
8815: diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him "not
8816: to be caught." Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
8817: parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the
8818: latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
8819: it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
8820: originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
8821: off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.
8822: 
8823: These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
8824: amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little
8825: daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her
8826: child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active
8827: and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told.
8828: Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
8829: with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
8830: waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
8831: in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
8832: more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the
8833: many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
8834: to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her "What is
8835: the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
8836: as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
8837: have too much to do?"
8838: 
8839: But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly
8840: in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
8841: little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
8842: as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.
8843: 
8844: On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
8845: Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and
8846: her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were
8847: all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
8848: lightning from the same place.
8849: 
8850: "I began to think," said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, "that
8851: I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of
8852: business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
8853: to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a
8854: run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able
8855: to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania
8856: among some of them for sending it to England."
8857: 
8858: "That has a bad look," said Darnay--
8859: 
8860: "A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason
8861: there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are
8862: getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course
8863: without due occasion."
8864: 
8865: "Still," said Darnay, "you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is."
8866: 
8867: "I know that, to be sure," assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
8868: himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, "but I
8869: am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. Where is
8870: Manette?"
8871: 
8872: "Here he is," said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.
8873: 
8874: "I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
8875: which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
8876: reason. You are not going out, I hope?"
8877: 
8878: "No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like," said the
8879: Doctor.
8880: 
8881: "I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
8882: pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't
8883: see."
8884: 
8885: "Of course, it has been kept for you."
8886: 
8887: "Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?"
8888: 
8889: "And sleeping soundly."
8890: 
8891: "That's right; all safe and well! I don't know why anything should be
8892: otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
8893: all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,
8894: come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
8895: the echoes about which you have your theory."
8896: 
8897: "Not a theory; it was a fancy."
8898: 
8899: "A fancy, then, my wise pet," said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. "They
8900: are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!"
8901: 
8902: Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's
8903: life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the
8904: footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
8905: the dark London window.
8906: 
8907: Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
8908: heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
8909: heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous
8910: roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms
8911: struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:
8912: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
8913: weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.
8914: 
8915: Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
8916: agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the
8917: heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
8918: have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
8919: powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
8920: weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who
8921: could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
8922: force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
8923: heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
8924: Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
8925: with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.
8926: 
8927: As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
8928: circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
8929: had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
8930: already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
8931: thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
8932: another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.
8933: 
8934: "Keep near to me, Jacques Three," cried Defarge; "and do you, Jacques
8935: One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
8936: patriots as you can. Where is my wife?"
8937: 
8938: "Eh, well! Here you see me!" said madame, composed as ever, but not
8939: knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
8940: in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol
8941: and a cruel knife.
8942: 
8943: "Where do you go, my wife?"
8944: 
8945: "I go," said madame, "with you at present. You shall see me at the head
8946: of women, by-and-bye."
8947: 
8948: "Come, then!" cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. "Patriots and
8949: friends, we are ready! The Bastille!"
8950: 
8951: With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
8952: into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
8953: depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums
8954: beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
8955: began.
8956: 
8957: Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
8958: towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
8959: the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
8960: a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the
8961: wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.
8962: 
8963: Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
8964: cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! "Work, comrades
8965: all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
8966: Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all
8967: the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!" Thus Defarge of the
8968: wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.
8969: 
8970: "To me, women!" cried madame his wife. "What! We can kill as well as
8971: the men when the place is taken!" And to her, with a shrill thirsty
8972: cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
8973: revenge.
8974: 
8975: Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
8976: drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
8977: displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing
8978: weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
8979: at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
8980: execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
8981: furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
8982: single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
8983: towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
8984: by the service of Four fierce hours.
8985: 
8986: A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
8987: perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
8988: the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the
8989: wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
8990: walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!
8991: 
8992: So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
8993: draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
8994: struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
8995: outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he
8996: made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;
8997: Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the
8998: inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,
8999: exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
9000: furious dumb-show.
9001: 
9002: "The Prisoners!"
9003: 
9004: "The Records!"
9005: 
9006: "The secret cells!"
9007: 
9008: "The instruments of torture!"
9009: 
9010: "The Prisoners!"
9011: 
9012: Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, "The Prisoners!" was
9013: the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
9014: eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
9015: billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
9016: threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
9017: undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
9018: these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his
9019: hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the
9020: wall.
9021: 
9022: "Show me the North Tower!" said Defarge. "Quick!"
9023: 
9024: "I will faithfully," replied the man, "if you will come with me. But
9025: there is no one there."
9026: 
9027: "What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?" asked
9028: Defarge. "Quick!"
9029: 
9030: "The meaning, monsieur?"
9031: 
9032: "Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I
9033: shall strike you dead?"
9034: 
9035: "Kill him!" croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.
9036: 
9037: "Monsieur, it is a cell."
9038: 
9039: "Show it me!"
9040: 
9041: "Pass this way, then."
9042: 
9043: Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed
9044: by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
9045: held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's. Their three heads had
9046: been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
9047: as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the
9048: noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
9049: its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around
9050: outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
9051: occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
9052: air like spray.
9053: 
9054: Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
9055: hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
9056: and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
9057: waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
9058: linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and
9059: there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;
9060: but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
9061: tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
9062: and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
9063: to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
9064: come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.
9065: 
9066: The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung
9067: the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
9068: in:
9069: 
9070: "One hundred and five, North Tower!"
9071: 
9072: There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
9073: with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
9074: stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
9075: across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
9076: on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were
9077: the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.
9078: 
9079: "Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them," said
9080: Defarge to the turnkey.
9081: 
9082: The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.
9083: 
9084: "Stop!--Look here, Jacques!"
9085: 
9086: "A. M.!" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.
9087: 
9088: "Alexandre Manette," said Defarge in his ear, following the letters
9089: with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. "And here he
9090: wrote 'a poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched
9091: a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it
9092: me!"
9093: 
9094: He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden
9095: exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
9096: table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
9097: 
9098: "Hold the light higher!" he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. "Look
9099: among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,"
9100: throwing it to him; "rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
9101: light higher, you!"
9102: 
9103: With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,
9104: peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,
9105: and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar
9106: and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and
9107: in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney
9108: into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a
9109: cautious touch.
9110: 
9111: "Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?"
9112: 
9113: "Nothing."
9114: 
9115: "Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
9116: them, you!"
9117: 
9118: The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping
9119: again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
9120: retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
9121: of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
9122: more.
9123: 
9124: They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
9125: Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard
9126: upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.
9127: Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
9128: judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's
9129: blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be
9130: unavenged.
9131: 
9132: In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
9133: encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
9134: decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a
9135: woman's. "See, there is my husband!" she cried, pointing him out.
9136: "See Defarge!" She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
9137: remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through
9138: the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable
9139: close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to
9140: be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the
9141: long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him
9142: when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot
9143: upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.
9144: 
9145: The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea
9146: of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint
9147: Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
9148: iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the
9149: governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge
9150: where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. "Lower
9151: the lamp yonder!" cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new
9152: means of death; "here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!" The
9153: swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.
9154: 
9155: The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
9156: of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
9157: were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
9158: voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
9159: until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.
9160: 
9161: But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
9162: in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
9163: fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
9164: more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
9165: released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
9166: overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last
9167: Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
9168: Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
9169: drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive
9170: faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
9171: faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
9172: lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, "THOU DIDST
9173: IT!"
9174: 
9175: Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
9176: accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters
9177: and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
9178: hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
9179: Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
9180: hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,
9181: and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,
9182: and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
9183: at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
9184: stained red.
9185: 
9186: 
9187: 
9188: 
9189: XXII. The Sea Still Rises
9190: 
9191: 
9192: Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
9193: his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
9194: the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
9195: Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
9196: Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of
9197: Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
9198: themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a
9199: portentously elastic swing with them.
9200: 
9201: Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
9202: contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several
9203: knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
9204: of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on
9205: the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: "I know how
9206: hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;
9207: but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
9208: destroy life in you?" Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
9209: before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
9210: The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
9211: they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;
9212: the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
9213: last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.
9214: 
9215: Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
9216: to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her
9217: sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved
9218: grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
9219: already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
9220: 
9221: "Hark!" said The Vengeance. "Listen, then! Who comes?"
9222: 
9223: As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
9224: Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
9225: murmur came rushing along.
9226: 
9227: "It is Defarge," said madame. "Silence, patriots!"
9228: 
9229: Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
9230: around him! "Listen, everywhere!" said madame again. "Listen to him!"
9231: Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open
9232: mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had
9233: sprung to their feet.
9234: 
9235: "Say then, my husband. What is it?"
9236: 
9237: "News from the other world!"
9238: 
9239: "How, then?" cried madame, contemptuously. "The other world?"
9240: 
9241: "Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people
9242: that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?"
9243: 
9244: "Everybody!" from all throats.
9245: 
9246: "The news is of him. He is among us!"
9247: 
9248: "Among us!" from the universal throat again. "And dead?"
9249: 
9250: "Not dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself
9251: to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have
9252: found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have
9253: seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have
9254: said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?"
9255: 
9256: Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
9257: never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
9258: could have heard the answering cry.
9259: 
9260: A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked
9261: steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
9262: was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.
9263: 
9264: "Patriots!" said Defarge, in a determined voice, "are we ready?"
9265: 
9266: Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating
9267: in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
9268: The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
9269: her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
9270: house, rousing the women.
9271: 
9272: The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
9273: from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
9274: the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From
9275: such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
9276: children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
9277: famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
9278: another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
9279: Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant
9280: Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
9281: these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
9282: alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon
9283: who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
9284: to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
9285: breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our
9286: suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
9287: knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,
9288: and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
9289: Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
9290: Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from
9291: him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
9292: whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
9293: dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
9294: belonging to them from being trampled under foot.
9295: 
9296: Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at
9297: the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew
9298: his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out
9299: of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
9300: such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
9301: a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the
9302: wailing children.
9303: 
9304: No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
9305: this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
9306: open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
9307: and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
9308: from him in the Hall.
9309: 
9310: "See!" cried madame, pointing with her knife. "See the old villain bound
9311: with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.
9312: Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!" Madame put her knife
9313: under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.
9314: 
9315: The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
9316: her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
9317: others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
9318: clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
9319: and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent
9320: expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
9321: a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
9322: wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
9323: to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a
9324: telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.
9325: 
9326: At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
9327: protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. The favour was
9328: too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
9329: stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got
9330: him!
9331: 
9332: It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge
9333: had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
9334: wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
9335: her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and
9336: Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
9337: had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
9338: perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, "Bring him
9339: out! Bring him to the lamp!"
9340: 
9341: Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on
9342: his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,
9343: and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
9344: face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
9345: entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
9346: action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
9347: another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
9348: a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
9349: of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat
9350: might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
9351: while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
9352: screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
9353: him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope
9354: broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope
9355: broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and
9356: held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the
9357: mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
9358: 
9359: Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
9360: and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
9361: the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the
9362: people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
9363: five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
9364: on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the
9365: breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on
9366: pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession
9367: through the streets.
9368: 
9369: Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
9370: wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by
9371: long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
9372: they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
9373: embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
9374: again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
9375: frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
9376: slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
9377: common, afterwards supping at their doors.
9378: 
9379: Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
9380: most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
9381: some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
9382: cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
9383: share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
9384: and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
9385: hoped.
9386: 
9387: It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last
9388: knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in
9389: husky tones, while fastening the door:
9390: 
9391: "At last it is come, my dear!"
9392: 
9393: "Eh well!" returned madame. "Almost."
9394: 
9395: Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
9396: her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum's was the
9397: only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
9398: Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
9399: the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
9400: was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
9401: Antoine's bosom.
9402: 
9403: 
9404: 
9405: 
9406: XXIII. Fire Rises
9407: 
9408: 
9409: There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where
9410: the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
9411: highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
9412: poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the
9413: crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
9414: but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
9415: them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
9416: be what he was ordered.
9417: 
9418: Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
9419: Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
9420: shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
9421: dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated
9422: animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
9423: out.
9424: 
9425: Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
9426: blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
9427: luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
9428: nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
9429: things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
9430: Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must
9431: be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it
9432: was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
9433: flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
9434: its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
9435: to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
9436: unaccountable.
9437: 
9438: But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like
9439: it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
9440: it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
9441: of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
9442: the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
9443: of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in
9444: the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the
9445: disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
9446: beautifying features of Monseigneur.
9447: 
9448: For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
9449: dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
9450: to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
9451: thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
9452: he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,
9453: and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
9454: foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
9455: a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
9456: without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
9457: aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
9458: mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many
9459: highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
9460: with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.
9461: 
9462: Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
9463: as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
9464: could get from a shower of hail.
9465: 
9466: The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,
9467: and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects
9468: in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
9469: intelligible:
9470: 
9471: "How goes it, Jacques?"
9472: 
9473: "All well, Jacques."
9474: 
9475: "Touch then!"
9476: 
9477: They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.
9478: 
9479: "No dinner?"
9480: 
9481: "Nothing but supper now," said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.
9482: 
9483: "It is the fashion," growled the man. "I meet no dinner anywhere."
9484: 
9485: He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
9486: steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
9487: it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
9488: thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
9489: 
9490: "Touch then." It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
9491: time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.
9492: 
9493: "To-night?" said the mender of roads.
9494: 
9495: "To-night," said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.
9496: 
9497: "Where?"
9498: 
9499: "Here."
9500: 
9501: He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
9502: one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
9503: of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
9504: 
9505: "Show me!" said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.
9506: 
9507: "See!" returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. "You go down
9508: here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--"
9509: 
9510: "To the Devil with all that!" interrupted the other, rolling his eye
9511: over the landscape. "_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
9512: Well?"
9513: 
9514: "Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
9515: village."
9516: 
9517: "Good. When do you cease to work?"
9518: 
9519: "At sunset."
9520: 
9521: "Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without
9522: resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you
9523: wake me?"
9524: 
9525: "Surely."
9526: 
9527: The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his
9528: great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He
9529: was fast asleep directly.
9530: 
9531: As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
9532: away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
9533: by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap
9534: now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the
9535: heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used
9536: his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
9537: The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
9538: red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
9539: beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen
9540: and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender
9541: of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were
9542: footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed
9543: with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long
9544: leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into
9545: sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at
9546: secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept
9547: with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.
9548: Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
9549: drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against
9550: this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
9551: looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
9552: obstacle, tending to centres all over France.
9553: 
9554: The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
9555: brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
9556: of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
9557: them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
9558: the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
9559: to go down into the village, roused him.
9560: 
9561: "Good!" said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. "Two leagues beyond the
9562: summit of the hill?"
9563: 
9564: "About."
9565: 
9566: "About. Good!"
9567: 
9568: The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
9569: according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
9570: squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
9571: appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
9572: When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
9573: as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A
9574: curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
9575: together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
9576: looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,
9577: chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
9578: alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
9579: chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
9580: the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
9581: to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.
9582: 
9583: The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
9584: solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
9585: the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace
9586: flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
9587: swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
9588: the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
9589: stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis
9590: had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
9591: heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
9592: branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
9593: lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
9594: was black again.
9595: 
9596: But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely
9597: visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
9598: Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,
9599: picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
9600: and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
9601: Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
9602: stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
9603: 
9604: A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
9605: there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was
9606: spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
9607: space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
9608: Gabelle's door. "Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!" The tocsin rang
9609: impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The
9610: mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
9611: with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
9612: sky. "It must be forty feet high," said they, grimly; and never moved.
9613: 
9614: The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
9615: through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
9616: the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;
9617: removed from them, a group of soldiers. "Help, gentlemen--officers! The
9618: chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
9619: timely aid! Help, help!" The officers looked towards the soldiers who
9620: looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
9621: of lips, "It must burn."
9622: 
9623: As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
9624: village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and
9625: fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
9626: lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
9627: every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
9628: occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
9629: Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
9630: that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
9631: authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
9632: and that post-horses would roast.
9633: 
9634: The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and
9635: raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
9636: infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising
9637: and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
9638: torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
9639: two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
9640: again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
9641: and contending with the fire.
9642: 
9643: The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
9644: scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce
9645: figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten
9646: lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran
9647: dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
9648: heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
9649: splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
9650: birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
9651: trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded
9652: roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
9653: destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
9654: abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.
9655: 
9656: Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
9657: bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
9658: the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
9659: of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
9660: days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
9661: house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
9662: Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
9663: with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
9664: withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
9665: resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
9666: of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
9667: parapet, and crush a man or two below.
9668: 
9669: Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
9670: distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,
9671: combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
9672: ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
9673: which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
9674: A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
9675: the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
9676: Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
9677: rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
9678: and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
9679: while.
9680: 
9681: Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
9682: other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
9683: the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
9684: had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
9685: less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
9686: functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
9687: in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
9688: North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
9689: The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
9690: no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
9691: successfully.
9692: 
9693: 
9694: 
9695: 
9696: XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock
9697: 
9698: 
9699: In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
9700: the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
9701: flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
9702: the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays
9703: of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
9704: tissue of the life of her home.
9705: 
9706: Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
9707: the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
9708: feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
9709: a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
9710: danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
9711: in.
9712: 
9713: Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
9714: his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
9715: to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
9716: this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
9717: infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
9718: ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
9719: boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
9720: and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
9721: sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.
9722: 
9723: The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the
9724: mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
9725: eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride,
9726: Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped
9727: out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
9728: outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
9729: all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
9730: "suspended," when the last tidings came over.
9731: 
9732: The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
9733: come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.
9734: 
9735: As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
9736: Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to
9737: haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
9738: without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.
9739: Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
9740: to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent
9741: house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
9742: from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
9743: storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
9744: provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
9745: by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer
9746: from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as
9747: a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
9748: time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
9749: was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
9750: consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news
9751: out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
9752: through Temple Bar to read.
9753: 
9754: On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles
9755: Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The
9756: penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
9757: the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an
9758: hour or so of the time of closing.
9759: 
9760: "But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived," said Charles
9761: Darnay, rather hesitating, "I must still suggest to you--"
9762: 
9763: "I understand. That I am too old?" said Mr. Lorry.
9764: 
9765: "Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
9766: disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you."
9767: 
9768: "My dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, "you touch
9769: some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe
9770: enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
9771: upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
9772: interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
9773: disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
9774: House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of
9775: old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
9776: long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
9777: myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all
9778: these years, who ought to be?"
9779: 
9780: "I wish I were going myself," said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
9781: and like one thinking aloud.
9782: 
9783: "Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!" exclaimed Mr.
9784: Lorry. "You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You
9785: are a wise counsellor."
9786: 
9787: "My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the
9788: thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through
9789: my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
9790: the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them," he spoke
9791: here in his former thoughtful manner, "that one might be listened to,
9792: and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,
9793: after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--"
9794: 
9795: "When you were talking to Lucie," Mr. Lorry repeated. "Yes. I wonder you
9796: are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to
9797: France at this time of day!"
9798: 
9799: "However, I am not going," said Charles Darnay, with a smile. "It is
9800: more to the purpose that you say you are."
9801: 
9802: "And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles," Mr. Lorry
9803: glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, "you can have no
9804: conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
9805: of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The
9806: Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
9807: of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
9808: might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
9809: afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
9810: with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
9811: getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of
9812: precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
9813: I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose
9814: bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
9815: the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!"
9816: 
9817: "How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry."
9818: 
9819: "Tut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
9820: the House again, "you are to remember, that getting things out of
9821: Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
9822: impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
9823: to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
9824: whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
9825: every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
9826: the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
9827: as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped."
9828: 
9829: "And do you really go to-night?"
9830: 
9831: "I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
9832: delay."
9833: 
9834: "And do you take no one with you?"
9835: 
9836: "All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
9837: to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
9838: bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
9839: Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
9840: of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
9841: master."
9842: 
9843: "I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
9844: youthfulness."
9845: 
9846: "I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little
9847: commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and
9848: live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old."
9849: 
9850: This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with
9851: Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he
9852: would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too
9853: much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it
9854: was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
9855: terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
9856: the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
9857: omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched
9858: millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
9859: should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
9860: years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such
9861: vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
9862: restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
9863: and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
9864: without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was
9865: such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
9866: in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
9867: already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.
9868: 
9869: Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his
9870: way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
9871: to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
9872: them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
9873: accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
9874: of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard
9875: with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
9876: going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
9877: word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.
9878: 
9879: The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
9880: before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
9881: whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay
9882: that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
9883: name. The address, turned into English, ran:
9884: 
9885: "Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of
9886: France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
9887: London, England."
9888: 
9889: On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and
9890: express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
9891: be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
9892: between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
9893: suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.
9894: 
9895: "No," said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; "I have referred it,
9896: I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
9897: gentleman is to be found."
9898: 
9899: The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there
9900: was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. He
9901: held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
9902: person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
9903: it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
9904: and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
9905: English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.
9906: 
9907: "Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the
9908: polished Marquis who was murdered," said one. "Happy to say, I never
9909: knew him."
9910: 
9911: "A craven who abandoned his post," said another--this Monseigneur had
9912: been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of
9913: hay--"some years ago."
9914: 
9915: "Infected with the new doctrines," said a third, eyeing the direction
9916: through his glass in passing; "set himself in opposition to the last
9917: Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to
9918: the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves."
9919: 
9920: "Hey?" cried the blatant Stryver. "Did he though? Is that the sort of
9921: fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!"
9922: 
9923: Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
9924: the shoulder, and said:
9925: 
9926: "I know the fellow."
9927: 
9928: "Do you, by Jupiter?" said Stryver. "I am sorry for it."
9929: 
9930: "Why?"
9931: 
9932: "Why, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these
9933: times."
9934: 
9935: "But I do ask why?"
9936: 
9937: "Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to
9938: hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
9939: who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
9940: ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
9941: that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a
9942: man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry
9943: because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's
9944: why."
9945: 
9946: Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
9947: said: "You may not understand the gentleman."
9948: 
9949: "I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay," said Bully
9950: Stryver, "and I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_
9951: understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also
9952: tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
9953: to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,
9954: gentlemen," said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,
9955: "I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never
9956: find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
9957: precious _proteges_. No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair
9958: of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away."
9959: 
9960: With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver
9961: shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
9962: his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,
9963: in the general departure from the Bank.
9964: 
9965: "Will you take charge of the letter?" said Mr. Lorry. "You know where to
9966: deliver it?"
9967: 
9968: "I do."
9969: 
9970: "Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
9971: addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
9972: that it has been here some time?"
9973: 
9974: "I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?"
9975: 
9976: "From here, at eight."
9977: 
9978: "I will come back, to see you off."
9979: 
9980: Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
9981: Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the
9982: letter, and read it. These were its contents:
9983: 
9984: 
9985: "Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.
9986: 
9987: "June 21, 1792. "MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.
9988: 
9989: "After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
9990: village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
9991: brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a
9992: great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
9993: ground.
9994: 
9995: "The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
9996: and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
9997: life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
9998: the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
9999: emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
10000: against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,
10001: before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
10002: imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
10003: had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
10004: an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?
10005: 
10006: "Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
10007: emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he
10008: not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
10009: I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
10010: ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!
10011: 
10012: "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
10013: your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to
10014: succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
10015: Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!
10016: 
10017: "From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
10018: nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the
10019: assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
10020: 
10021: "Your afflicted,
10022: 
10023: "Gabelle."
10024: 
10025: 
10026: The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life
10027: by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
10028: only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
10029: reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple
10030: considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.
10031: 
10032: He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
10033: the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
10034: resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his
10035: conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
10036: he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
10037: his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
10038: mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
10039: systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
10040: do it, and that it had never been done.
10041: 
10042: The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being
10043: always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
10044: which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
10045: annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
10046: following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
10047: these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
10048: without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched
10049: the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
10050: until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
10051: France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
10052: confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
10053: was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
10054: France that might impeach him for it.
10055: 
10056: But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
10057: far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
10058: relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
10059: favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
10060: bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
10061: on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
10062: there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
10063: in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
10064: the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
10065: own safety, so that it could not but appear now.
10066: 
10067: This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
10068: that he would go to Paris.
10069: 
10070: Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
10071: him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him
10072: to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted
10073: him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
10074: attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
10075: worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
10076: could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
10077: trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
10078: and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
10079: him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
10080: brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
10081: (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
10082: which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
10083: coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's
10084: letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
10085: justice, honour, and good name.
10086: 
10087: His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.
10088: 
10089: Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
10090: struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention
10091: with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left
10092: it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
10093: gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert
10094: it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the
10095: sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even
10096: saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
10097: Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.
10098: 
10099: As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
10100: neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.
10101: Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always
10102: reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,
10103: should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
10104: the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his
10105: situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety
10106: to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not
10107: discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
10108: in his course.
10109: 
10110: He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
10111: return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
10112: in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
10113: nothing of his intention now.
10114: 
10115: A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was
10116: booted and equipped.
10117: 
10118: "I have delivered that letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. "I
10119: would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
10120: perhaps you will take a verbal one?"
10121: 
10122: "That I will, and readily," said Mr. Lorry, "if it is not dangerous."
10123: 
10124: "Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye."
10125: 
10126: "What is his name?" said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
10127: hand.
10128: 
10129: "Gabelle."
10130: 
10131: "Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?"
10132: 
10133: "Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.'"
10134: 
10135: "Any time mentioned?"
10136: 
10137: "He will start upon his journey to-morrow night."
10138: 
10139: "Any person mentioned?"
10140: 
10141: "No."
10142: 
10143: He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
10144: and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the
10145: misty air of Fleet-street. "My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie," said
10146: Mr. Lorry at parting, "and take precious care of them till I come back."
10147: Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
10148: rolled away.
10149: 
10150: That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote
10151: two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation
10152: he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
10153: that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
10154: personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
10155: their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
10156: strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
10157: in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.
10158: 
10159: It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
10160: reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to
10161: preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
10162: But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him
10163: resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
10164: so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
10165: the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
10166: scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye
10167: (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise
10168: of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
10169: streets, with a heavier heart.
10170: 
10171: The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides
10172: and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his
10173: two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
10174: midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
10175: "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
10176: your noble name!" was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened
10177: his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
10178: floated away for the Loadstone Rock.
10179: 
10180: 
10181: The end of the second book.
10182: 
10183: 
10184: 
10185: 
10186: 
10187: Book the Third--the Track of a Storm
10188: 
10189: 
10190: 
10191: 
10192: I. In Secret
10193: 
10194: 
10195: The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
10196: England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
10197: ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
10198: horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
10199: unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
10200: but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
10201: these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
10202: citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
10203: of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
10204: inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
10205: turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
10206: hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
10207: Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
10208: Death.
10209: 
10210: A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles
10211: Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
10212: was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
10213: at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end.
10214: Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across
10215: the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in
10216: the series that was barred between him and England. The universal
10217: watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,
10218: or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have
10219: felt his freedom more completely gone.
10220: 
10221: This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
10222: times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
10223: riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
10224: by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been
10225: days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
10226: a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.
10227: 
10228: Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his
10229: prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the
10230: guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
10231: to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
10232: a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
10233: had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.
10234: 
10235: Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
10236: red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.
10237: 
10238: "Emigrant," said the functionary, "I am going to send you on to Paris,
10239: under an escort."
10240: 
10241: "Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
10242: dispense with the escort."
10243: 
10244: "Silence!" growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
10245: of his musket. "Peace, aristocrat!"
10246: 
10247: "It is as the good patriot says," observed the timid functionary. "You
10248: are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it."
10249: 
10250: "I have no choice," said Charles Darnay.
10251: 
10252: "Choice! Listen to him!" cried the same scowling red-cap. "As if it was
10253: not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!"
10254: 
10255: "It is always as the good patriot says," observed the functionary. "Rise
10256: and dress yourself, emigrant."
10257: 
10258: Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
10259: patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
10260: a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
10261: started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.
10262: 
10263: The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
10264: cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
10265: side of him.
10266: 
10267: The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to
10268: his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
10269: wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
10270: faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
10271: and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
10272: change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
10273: between them and the capital.
10274: 
10275: They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
10276: lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,
10277: that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
10278: shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of
10279: being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
10280: as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
10281: his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
10282: that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
10283: he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
10284: of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
10285: confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.
10286: 
10287: But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
10288: when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
10289: himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd
10290: gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
10291: out loudly, "Down with the emigrant!"
10292: 
10293: He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
10294: resuming it as his safest place, said:
10295: 
10296: "Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
10297: will?"
10298: 
10299: "You are a cursed emigrant," cried a farrier, making at him in a
10300: furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; "and you are a cursed
10301: aristocrat!"
10302: 
10303: The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's
10304: bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, "Let him
10305: be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris."
10306: 
10307: "Judged!" repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. "Ay! and condemned
10308: as a traitor." At this the crowd roared approval.
10309: 
10310: Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to the
10311: yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with
10312: the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his
10313: voice heard:
10314: 
10315: "Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
10316: traitor."
10317: 
10318: "He lies!" cried the smith. "He is a traitor since the decree. His life
10319: is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!"
10320: 
10321: At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which
10322: another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his
10323: horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks,
10324: and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier
10325: struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no
10326: more was done.
10327: 
10328: "What is this decree that the smith spoke of?" Darnay asked the
10329: postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.
10330: 
10331: "Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants."
10332: 
10333: "When passed?"
10334: 
10335: "On the fourteenth."
10336: 
10337: "The day I left England!"
10338: 
10339: "Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
10340: others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
10341: condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said
10342: your life was not your own."
10343: 
10344: "But there are no such decrees yet?"
10345: 
10346: "What do I know!" said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; "there
10347: may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?"
10348: 
10349: They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and
10350: then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many
10351: wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
10352: unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and
10353: lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
10354: cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
10355: would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
10356: circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
10357: up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
10358: Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
10359: into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
10360: wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
10361: that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
10362: the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
10363: way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
10364: 
10365: Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
10366: closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.
10367: 
10368: "Where are the papers of this prisoner?" demanded a resolute-looking man
10369: in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
10370: 
10371: Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the
10372: speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,
10373: in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
10374: imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.
10375: 
10376: "Where," repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
10377: whatever, "are the papers of this prisoner?"
10378: 
10379: The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his
10380: eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some
10381: disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.
10382: 
10383: He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
10384: into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
10385: gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
10386: Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
10387: patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
10388: into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
10389: traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
10390: people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not
10391: to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
10392: forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they
10393: filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew
10394: their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the
10395: ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
10396: about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
10397: and women.
10398: 
10399: When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
10400: things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
10401: who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the
10402: escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
10403: to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
10404: turned and rode away without entering the city.
10405: 
10406: He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
10407: and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
10408: drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
10409: waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The
10410: light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of
10411: the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
10412: uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
10413: officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.
10414: 
10415: "Citizen Defarge," said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of
10416: paper to write on. "Is this the emigrant Evremonde?"
10417: 
10418: "This is the man."
10419: 
10420: "Your age, Evremonde?"
10421: 
10422: "Thirty-seven."
10423: 
10424: "Married, Evremonde?"
10425: 
10426: "Yes."
10427: 
10428: "Where married?"
10429: 
10430: "In England."
10431: 
10432: "Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?"
10433: 
10434: "In England."
10435: 
10436: "Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
10437: Force."
10438: 
10439: "Just Heaven!" exclaimed Darnay. "Under what law, and for what offence?"
10440: 
10441: The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.
10442: 
10443: "We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here." He
10444: said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.
10445: 
10446: "I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
10447: to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I
10448: demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that
10449: my right?"
10450: 
10451: "Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde," was the stolid reply. The officer
10452: wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
10453: sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words "In secret."
10454: 
10455: Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
10456: him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
10457: them.
10458: 
10459: "Is it you," said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
10460: guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, "who married the daughter of
10461: Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?"
10462: 
10463: "Yes," replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.
10464: 
10465: "My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
10466: Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me."
10467: 
10468: "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!"
10469: 
10470: The word "wife" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
10471: with sudden impatience, "In the name of that sharp female newly-born,
10472: and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?"
10473: 
10474: "You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
10475: truth?"
10476: 
10477: "A bad truth for you," said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
10478: looking straight before him.
10479: 
10480: "Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
10481: sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a
10482: little help?"
10483: 
10484: "None." Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.
10485: 
10486: "Will you answer me a single question?"
10487: 
10488: "Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is."
10489: 
10490: "In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
10491: communication with the world outside?"
10492: 
10493: "You will see."
10494: 
10495: "I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
10496: presenting my case?"
10497: 
10498: "You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried
10499: in worse prisons, before now."
10500: 
10501: "But never by me, Citizen Defarge."
10502: 
10503: Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
10504: and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
10505: there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
10506: He, therefore, made haste to say:
10507: 
10508: "It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
10509: than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to
10510: Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
10511: the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the
10512: prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?"
10513: 
10514: "I will do," Defarge doggedly rejoined, "nothing for you. My duty is to
10515: my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.
10516: I will do nothing for you."
10517: 
10518: Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
10519: was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
10520: how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
10521: streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
10522: their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
10523: otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
10524: more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
10525: going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
10526: passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
10527: audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
10528: family. The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made
10529: it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
10530: foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at
10531: Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal
10532: watchfulness had completely isolated him.
10533: 
10534: That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
10535: developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That
10536: perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
10537: yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he
10538: might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events
10539: of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
10540: the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future
10541: was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
10542: hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
10543: rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
10544: garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
10545: been a hundred thousand years away. The "sharp female newly-born, and
10546: called La Guillotine," was hardly known to him, or to the generality
10547: of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
10548: probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could
10549: they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?
10550: 
10551: Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
10552: from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
10553: certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
10554: his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
10555: arrived at the prison of La Force.
10556: 
10557: A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
10558: presented "The Emigrant Evremonde."
10559: 
10560: "What the Devil! How many more of them!" exclaimed the man with the
10561: bloated face.
10562: 
10563: Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,
10564: with his two fellow-patriots.
10565: 
10566: "What the Devil, I say again!" exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.
10567: "How many more!"
10568: 
10569: The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely
10570: replied, "One must have patience, my dear!" Three turnkeys who entered
10571: responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, "For
10572: the love of Liberty;" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
10573: conclusion.
10574: 
10575: The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
10576: horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome
10577: flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
10578: are ill cared for!
10579: 
10580: "In secret, too," grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. "As
10581: if I was not already full to bursting!"
10582: 
10583: He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
10584: awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
10585: fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
10586: either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
10587: subordinates.
10588: 
10589: "Come!" said the chief, at length taking up his keys, "come with me,
10590: emigrant."
10591: 
10592: Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
10593: corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
10594: until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
10595: prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
10596: and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
10597: most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
10598: room.
10599: 
10600: In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
10601: disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
10602: unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
10603: receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
10604: all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
10605: 
10606: So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
10607: gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
10608: misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
10609: in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost
10610: of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
10611: frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
10612: waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
10613: that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.
10614: 
10615: It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other
10616: gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
10617: in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
10618: coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
10619: there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the
10620: mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and
10621: likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
10622: utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress
10623: of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!
10624: 
10625: "In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune," said a
10626: gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, "I have the
10627: honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
10628: on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate
10629: happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
10630: to ask your name and condition?"
10631: 
10632: Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
10633: words as suitable as he could find.
10634: 
10635: "But I hope," said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
10636: eyes, who moved across the room, "that you are not in secret?"
10637: 
10638: "I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say
10639: so."
10640: 
10641: "Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
10642: members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
10643: but a short time." Then he added, raising his voice, "I grieve to inform
10644: the society--in secret."
10645: 
10646: There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room
10647: to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
10648: which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
10649: him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to
10650: render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and
10651: the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.
10652: 
10653: The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had
10654: ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
10655: them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a
10656: solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.
10657: 
10658: "Yours," said the gaoler.
10659: 
10660: "Why am I confined alone?"
10661: 
10662: "How do I know!"
10663: 
10664: "I can buy pen, ink, and paper?"
10665: 
10666: "Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
10667: present, you may buy your food, and nothing more."
10668: 
10669: There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
10670: the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
10671: walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
10672: the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
10673: was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
10674: a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was
10675: gone, he thought in the same wandering way, "Now am I left, as if I were
10676: dead." Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
10677: with a sick feeling, and thought, "And here in these crawling creatures
10678: is the first condition of the body after death."
10679: 
10680: "Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
10681: paces by four and a half." The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
10682: counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
10683: drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. "He made shoes, he made
10684: shoes, he made shoes." The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
10685: paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
10686: "The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among
10687: them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
10688: embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden
10689: hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
10690: through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He
10691: made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and
10692: a half." With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
10693: his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
10694: and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
10695: still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he
10696: knew, in the swell that rose above them.
10697: 
10698: 
10699: 
10700: 
10701: II. The Grindstone
10702: 
10703: 
10704: Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
10705: in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
10706: the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to
10707: a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
10708: troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. A
10709: mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his
10710: metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation
10711: of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
10712: besides the cook in question.
10713: 
10714: Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
10715: sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and
10716: willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and
10717: indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's
10718: house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all
10719: things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
10720: precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month
10721: of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
10722: Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
10723: drinking brandy in its state apartments.
10724: 
10725: A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
10726: would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
10727: For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
10728: said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
10729: over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had whitewashed the
10730: Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
10731: linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
10732: night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
10733: Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
10734: the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
10735: also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
10736: provocation. Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things
10737: exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
10738: taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.
10739: 
10740: What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would
10741: lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
10742: Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,
10743: and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
10744: Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
10745: the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
10746: Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
10747: a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was
10748: prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a
10749: deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
10750: room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.
10751: 
10752: He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
10753: he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they
10754: derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
10755: building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
10756: that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did
10757: his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,
10758: was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
10759: of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
10760: great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the
10761: open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
10762: to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
10763: or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
10764: objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had
10765: opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and
10766: he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
10767: 
10768: From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came
10769: the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring
10770: in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
10771: nature were going up to Heaven.
10772: 
10773: "Thank God," said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, "that no one near and
10774: dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all
10775: who are in danger!"
10776: 
10777: Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
10778: "They have come back!" and sat listening. But, there was no loud
10779: irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
10780: clash again, and all was quiet.
10781: 
10782: The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
10783: uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
10784: awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to
10785: go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly
10786: opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in
10787: amazement.
10788: 
10789: Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with
10790: that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
10791: seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
10792: force and power to it in this one passage of her life.
10793: 
10794: "What is this?" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. "What is the
10795: matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
10796: What is it?"
10797: 
10798: With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted
10799: out in his arms, imploringly, "O my dear friend! My husband!"
10800: 
10801: "Your husband, Lucie?"
10802: 
10803: "Charles."
10804: 
10805: "What of Charles?"
10806: 
10807: "Here.
10808: 
10809: "Here, in Paris?"
10810: 
10811: "Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't
10812: collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
10813: us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison."
10814: 
10815: The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the
10816: bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
10817: came pouring into the courtyard.
10818: 
10819: "What is that noise?" said the Doctor, turning towards the window.
10820: 
10821: "Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry. "Don't look out! Manette, for your life,
10822: don't touch the blind!"
10823: 
10824: The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and
10825: said, with a cool, bold smile:
10826: 
10827: "My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been
10828: a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In
10829: France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
10830: touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
10831: My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
10832: barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
10833: knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
10834: told Lucie so.--What is that noise?" His hand was again upon the window.
10835: 
10836: "Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. "No, Lucie, my
10837: dear, nor you!" He got his arm round her, and held her. "Don't be so
10838: terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
10839: having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
10840: this fatal place. What prison is he in?"
10841: 
10842: "La Force!"
10843: 
10844: "La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
10845: your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
10846: do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
10847: I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
10848: you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you
10849: to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must
10850: instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a
10851: room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
10852: two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
10853: delay."
10854: 
10855: "I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do
10856: nothing else than this. I know you are true."
10857: 
10858: The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the
10859: key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and
10860: partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and
10861: looked out with him into the courtyard.
10862: 
10863: Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
10864: enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The
10865: people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they
10866: had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up
10867: there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.
10868: 
10869: But, such awful workers, and such awful work!
10870: 
10871: The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
10872: men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
10873: the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
10874: the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
10875: False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
10876: hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
10877: howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
10878: sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
10879: forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
10880: held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
10881: blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks
10882: struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
10883: fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
10884: the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the
10885: sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all
10886: over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain
10887: upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace
10888: and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through
10889: and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
10890: sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to
10891: the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
10892: of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And
10893: as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
10894: of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in
10895: their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
10896: given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.
10897: 
10898: All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of
10899: any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
10900: were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for
10901: explanation in his friend's ashy face.
10902: 
10903: "They are," Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
10904: the locked room, "murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you
10905: say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you
10906: have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It
10907: may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!"
10908: 
10909: Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
10910: and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.
10911: 
10912: His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
10913: confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
10914: carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
10915: For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
10916: the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
10917: surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all
10918: linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
10919: cries of--"Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's
10920: kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save
10921: the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!" and a thousand answering shouts.
10922: 
10923: He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
10924: and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
10925: assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
10926: her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
10927: surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
10928: watching them in such quiet as the night knew.
10929: 
10930: Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
10931: clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
10932: bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
10933: charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O
10934: the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!
10935: 
10936: Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the
10937: irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
10938: "What is it?" cried Lucie, affrighted. "Hush! The soldiers' swords are
10939: sharpened there," said Mr. Lorry. "The place is national property now,
10940: and used as a kind of armoury, my love."
10941: 
10942: Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
10943: Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
10944: from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
10945: besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
10946: to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by
10947: the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
10948: Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
10949: the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
10950: climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its
10951: dainty cushions.
10952: 
10953: The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
10954: and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood
10955: alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had
10956: never given, and would never take away.
10957: 
10958: 
10959: 
10960: 
10961: III. The Shadow
10962: 
10963: 
10964: One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
10965: Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
10966: imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
10967: the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
10968: for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust
10969: he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
10970: man of business.
10971: 
10972: At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out
10973: the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
10974: the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
10975: same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
10976: most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
10977: its dangerous workings.
10978: 
10979: Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay
10980: tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said
10981: that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that
10982: Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to
10983: this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
10984: he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
10985: went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
10986: in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
10987: of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.
10988: 
10989: To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:
10990: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
10991: He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
10992: considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.
10993: A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
10994: and heavily the day lagged on with him.
10995: 
10996: It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He
10997: was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to
10998: do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
10999: man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
11000: addressed him by his name.
11001: 
11002: "Your servant," said Mr. Lorry. "Do you know me?"
11003: 
11004: He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
11005: to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
11006: emphasis, the words:
11007: 
11008: "Do you know me?"
11009: 
11010: "I have seen you somewhere."
11011: 
11012: "Perhaps at my wine-shop?"
11013: 
11014: Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: "You come from Doctor
11015: Manette?"
11016: 
11017: "Yes. I come from Doctor Manette."
11018: 
11019: "And what says he? What does he send me?"
11020: 
11021: Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the
11022: words in the Doctor's writing:
11023: 
11024:     "Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
11025:      I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
11026:      from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife."
11027: 
11028: It was dated from La Force, within an hour.
11029: 
11030: "Will you accompany me," said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
11031: this note aloud, "to where his wife resides?"
11032: 
11033: "Yes," returned Defarge.
11034: 
11035: Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
11036: way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
11037: courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.
11038: 
11039: "Madame Defarge, surely!" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly
11040: the same attitude some seventeen years ago.
11041: 
11042: "It is she," observed her husband.
11043: 
11044: "Does Madame go with us?" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as
11045: they moved.
11046: 
11047: "Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.
11048: It is for their safety."
11049: 
11050: Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
11051: at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being
11052: The Vengeance.
11053: 
11054: They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
11055: ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
11056: and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
11057: tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
11058: delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in
11059: the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.
11060: 
11061:      "DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has
11062:       influence around me.  You cannot answer this.
11063:       Kiss our child for me."
11064: 
11065: That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received
11066: it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
11067: hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
11068: action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
11069: to its knitting again.
11070: 
11071: There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in
11072: the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
11073: neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted
11074: eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.
11075: 
11076: "My dear," said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; "there are frequent
11077: risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
11078: trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
11079: to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
11080: may identify them. I believe," said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his
11081: reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
11082: upon him more and more, "I state the case, Citizen Defarge?"
11083: 
11084: Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
11085: gruff sound of acquiescence.
11086: 
11087: "You had better, Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
11088: propitiate, by tone and manner, "have the dear child here, and our
11089: good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
11090: French."
11091: 
11092: The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
11093: match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
11094: appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,
11095: whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope
11096: _you_ are pretty well!" She also bestowed a British cough on Madame
11097: Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.
11098: 
11099: "Is that his child?" said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the
11100: first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
11101: were the finger of Fate.
11102: 
11103: "Yes, madame," answered Mr. Lorry; "this is our poor prisoner's darling
11104: daughter, and only child."
11105: 
11106: The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so
11107: threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively
11108: kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The
11109: shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,
11110: threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
11111: 
11112: "It is enough, my husband," said Madame Defarge. "I have seen them. We
11113: may go."
11114: 
11115: But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
11116: presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
11117: she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:
11118: 
11119: "You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will
11120: help me to see him if you can?"
11121: 
11122: "Your husband is not my business here," returned Madame Defarge, looking
11123: down at her with perfect composure. "It is the daughter of your father
11124: who is my business here."
11125: 
11126: "For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She
11127: will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more
11128: afraid of you than of these others."
11129: 
11130: Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
11131: Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,
11132: collected his face into a sterner expression.
11133: 
11134: "What is it that your husband says in that little letter?" asked Madame
11135: Defarge, with a lowering smile. "Influence; he says something touching
11136: influence?"
11137: 
11138: "That my father," said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
11139: breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, "has
11140: much influence around him."
11141: 
11142: "Surely it will release him!" said Madame Defarge. "Let it do so."
11143: 
11144: "As a wife and mother," cried Lucie, most earnestly, "I implore you to
11145: have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
11146: my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think
11147: of me. As a wife and mother!"
11148: 
11149: Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
11150: turning to her friend The Vengeance:
11151: 
11152: "The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
11153: as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have
11154: known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
11155: often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
11156: themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
11157: sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?"
11158: 
11159: "We have seen nothing else," returned The Vengeance.
11160: 
11161: "We have borne this a long time," said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes
11162: again upon Lucie. "Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife
11163: and mother would be much to us now?"
11164: 
11165: She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge
11166: went last, and closed the door.
11167: 
11168: "Courage, my dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. "Courage,
11169: courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
11170: late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart."
11171: 
11172: "I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
11173: shadow on me and on all my hopes."
11174: 
11175: "Tut, tut!" said Mr. Lorry; "what is this despondency in the brave
11176: little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie."
11177: 
11178: But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
11179: for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.
11180: 
11181: 
11182: 
11183: 
11184: IV. Calm in Storm
11185: 
11186: 
11187: Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
11188: absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
11189: kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
11190: not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
11191: know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
11192: ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
11193: darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been
11194: tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon
11195: the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
11196: some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
11197: 
11198: To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
11199: which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a
11200: scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had
11201: found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were
11202: brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
11203: to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back
11204: to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he
11205: had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
11206: years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the
11207: body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this
11208: man was Defarge.
11209: 
11210: That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
11211: that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
11212: to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
11213: dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
11214: and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
11215: a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
11216: to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and
11217: examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
11218: the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
11219: to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,
11220: the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
11221: the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
11222: inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
11223: was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the
11224: Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
11225: assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
11226: delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
11227: often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and
11228: had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.
11229: 
11230: The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
11231: intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
11232: saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
11233: those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had
11234: been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
11235: thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress
11236: the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him
11237: in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies
11238: of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
11239: awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
11240: with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him
11241: carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
11242: anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes
11243: with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.
11244: 
11245: As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of
11246: his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that
11247: such dread experiences would revive the old danger.
11248: 
11249: But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
11250: at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
11251: felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
11252: he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
11253: could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him.
11254: "It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
11255: As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
11256: helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
11257: of Heaven I will do it!" Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw
11258: the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
11259: of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
11260: clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
11261: had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.
11262: 
11263: Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
11264: have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself
11265: in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
11266: of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his
11267: personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician
11268: of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
11269: that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the
11270: general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
11271: messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself
11272: sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was
11273: not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of
11274: plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
11275: known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.
11276: 
11277: This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the
11278: sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
11279: Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
11280: but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that
11281: time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
11282: and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
11283: Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through
11284: that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's
11285: ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,
11286: that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to
11287: trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself
11288: and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
11289: affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
11290: rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. "All
11291: curious to see," thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, "but all
11292: natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
11293: couldn't be in better hands."
11294: 
11295: But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
11296: Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
11297: the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new
11298: era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of
11299: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
11300: against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
11301: great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
11302: against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
11303: of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and
11304: had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
11305: alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of
11306: the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
11307: and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the
11308: fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
11309: What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year
11310: One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
11311: and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!
11312: 
11313: There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
11314: measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
11315: time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other
11316: count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever
11317: of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
11318: unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
11319: head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
11320: head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
11321: widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
11322: 
11323: And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
11324: all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A
11325: revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand
11326: revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,
11327: which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
11328: any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
11329: with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
11330: these things became the established order and nature of appointed
11331: things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
11332: Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
11333: the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the
11334: sharp female called La Guillotine.
11335: 
11336: It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
11337: it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
11338: peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
11339: shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
11340: and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the
11341: human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts
11342: from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
11343: believed in where the Cross was denied.
11344: 
11345: It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,
11346: were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young
11347: Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed
11348: the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and
11349: good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
11350: dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
11351: The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief
11352: functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his
11353: namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every
11354: day.
11355: 
11356: Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked
11357: with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his
11358: end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last. Yet the
11359: current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
11360: away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
11361: months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more
11362: wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
11363: that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
11364: violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
11365: under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the
11366: terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
11367: that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
11368: in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
11369: victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the
11370: appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all
11371: other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
11372: he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
11373: a Spirit moving among mortals.
11374: 
11375: 
11376: 
11377: 
11378: V. The Wood-Sawyer
11379: 
11380: 
11381: One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never
11382: sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her
11383: husband's head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the
11384: tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright
11385: women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
11386: old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
11387: daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,
11388: and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.
11389: Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
11390: bestow, O Guillotine!
11391: 
11392: If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
11393: had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle
11394: despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
11395: the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
11396: the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
11397: truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
11398: will always be.
11399: 
11400: As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father
11401: had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
11402: household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
11403: its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,
11404: as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The
11405: slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
11406: that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy
11407: return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the
11408: solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many
11409: unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
11410: outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.
11411: 
11412: She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to
11413: mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well
11414: attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,
11415: and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
11416: thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at
11417: night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had
11418: repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,
11419: was on him. He always resolutely answered: "Nothing can happen to him
11420: without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie."
11421: 
11422: They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her
11423: father said to her, on coming home one evening:
11424: 
11425: "My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can
11426: sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to
11427: it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you
11428: in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
11429: show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
11430: if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition."
11431: 
11432: "O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day."
11433: 
11434: From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
11435: clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
11436: When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
11437: went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
11438: single day.
11439: 
11440: It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
11441: of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
11442: end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
11443: her.
11444: 
11445: "Good day, citizeness."
11446: 
11447: "Good day, citizen."
11448: 
11449: This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been
11450: established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
11451: but, was now law for everybody.
11452: 
11453: "Walking here again, citizeness?"
11454: 
11455: "You see me, citizen!"
11456: 
11457: The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he
11458: had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed
11459: at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
11460: bars, peeped through them jocosely.
11461: 
11462: "But it's not my business," said he. And went on sawing his wood.
11463: 
11464: Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she
11465: appeared.
11466: 
11467: "What? Walking here again, citizeness?"
11468: 
11469: "Yes, citizen."
11470: 
11471: "Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?"
11472: 
11473: "Do I say yes, mamma?" whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.
11474: 
11475: "Yes, dearest."
11476: 
11477: "Yes, citizen."
11478: 
11479: "Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I
11480: call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
11481: comes!"
11482: 
11483: The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.
11484: 
11485: "I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
11486: Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child.
11487: Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the
11488: family!"
11489: 
11490: Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was
11491: impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
11492: his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
11493: first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.
11494: 
11495: He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
11496: him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart
11497: up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,
11498: with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. "But it's
11499: not my business!" he would generally say at those times, and would
11500: briskly fall to his sawing again.
11501: 
11502: In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
11503: spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
11504: in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
11505: this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
11506: Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in
11507: five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
11508: for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
11509: see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
11510: waited out the day, seven days a week.
11511: 
11512: These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her
11513: father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing
11514: afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild
11515: rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along,
11516: decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
11517: also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
11518: (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.
11519: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!
11520: 
11521: The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
11522: surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
11523: somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in
11524: with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike
11525: and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his
11526: saw inscribed as his "Little Sainte Guillotine"--for the great sharp
11527: female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
11528: was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.
11529: 
11530: But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
11531: and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment
11532: afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
11533: prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
11534: The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
11535: they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music
11536: than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,
11537: keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
11538: Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
11539: together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a
11540: mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
11541: filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
11542: apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
11543: advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
11544: another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
11545: in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
11546: linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
11547: and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
11548: all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
11549: reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
11550: again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
11551: of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
11552: up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
11553: as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
11554: innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
11555: a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
11556: heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
11557: warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly
11558: bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
11559: delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
11560: the disjointed time.
11561: 
11562: This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
11563: bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow
11564: fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.
11565: 
11566: "O my father!" for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
11567: had momentarily darkened with her hand; "such a cruel, bad sight."
11568: 
11569: "I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don't be
11570: frightened! Not one of them would harm you."
11571: 
11572: "I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
11573: husband, and the mercies of these people--"
11574: 
11575: "We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to
11576: the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may
11577: kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof."
11578: 
11579: "I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!"
11580: 
11581: "You cannot see him, my poor dear?"
11582: 
11583: "No, father," said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,
11584: "no."
11585: 
11586: A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. "I salute you, citizeness,"
11587: from the Doctor. "I salute you, citizen." This in passing. Nothing more.
11588: Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.
11589: 
11590: "Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
11591: and courage, for his sake. That was well done;" they had left the spot;
11592: "it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow."
11593: 
11594: "For to-morrow!"
11595: 
11596: "There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions
11597: to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
11598: before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know
11599: that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the
11600: Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?"
11601: 
11602: She could scarcely answer, "I trust in you."
11603: 
11604: "Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall
11605: be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every
11606: protection. I must see Lorry."
11607: 
11608: He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They
11609: both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring
11610: away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.
11611: 
11612: "I must see Lorry," the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.
11613: 
11614: The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
11615: and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
11616: and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No
11617: better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to
11618: hold his peace.
11619: 
11620: A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted
11621: the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the
11622: Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
11623: deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:
11624: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
11625: Fraternity, or Death!
11626: 
11627: Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the
11628: chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,
11629: agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did
11630: he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and
11631: turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,
11632: he said: "Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?"
11633: 
11634: 
11635: 
11636: 
11637: VI. Triumph
11638: 
11639: 
11640: The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
11641: Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were
11642: read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The
11643: standard gaoler-joke was, "Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you
11644: inside there!"
11645: 
11646: "Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!"
11647: 
11648: So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.
11649: 
11650: When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
11651: for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles
11652: Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen
11653: hundreds pass away so.
11654: 
11655: His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
11656: to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the
11657: list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three
11658: names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so
11659: summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
11660: guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber
11661: where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
11662: arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
11663: creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
11664: scaffold.
11665: 
11666: There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was
11667: soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force
11668: were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
11669: concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears
11670: there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
11671: refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the
11672: common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
11673: who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from
11674: insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
11675: time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour
11676: or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
11677: brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
11678: boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In
11679: seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
11680: disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have
11681: like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
11682: them.
11683: 
11684: The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
11685: vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were
11686: put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the fifteen
11687: were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.
11688: 
11689: "Charles Evremonde, called Darnay," was at length arraigned.
11690: 
11691: His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
11692: and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking
11693: at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the
11694: usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
11695: honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never
11696: without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing
11697: spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
11698: anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
11699: the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
11700: knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
11701: knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
11702: her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
11703: he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
11704: remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
11705: his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
11706: in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
11707: himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to
11708: be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
11709: the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
11710: in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
11711: Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
11712: wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
11713: Carmagnole.
11714: 
11715: Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
11716: as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree
11717: which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the
11718: decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was
11719: the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.
11720: 
11721: "Take off his head!" cried the audience. "An enemy to the Republic!"
11722: 
11723: The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the
11724: prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
11725: England?
11726: 
11727: Undoubtedly it was.
11728: 
11729: Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?
11730: 
11731: Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.
11732: 
11733: Why not? the President desired to know.
11734: 
11735: Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
11736: to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left
11737: his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
11738: acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
11739: England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.
11740: 
11741: What proof had he of this?
11742: 
11743: He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
11744: Alexandre Manette.
11745: 
11746: But he had married in England? the President reminded him.
11747: 
11748: True, but not an English woman.
11749: 
11750: A citizeness of France?
11751: 
11752: Yes. By birth.
11753: 
11754: Her name and family?
11755: 
11756: "Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
11757: sits there."
11758: 
11759: This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation
11760: of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were
11761: the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
11762: countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
11763: if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.
11764: 
11765: On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot
11766: according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same cautious
11767: counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
11768: inch of his road.
11769: 
11770: The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not
11771: sooner?
11772: 
11773: He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
11774: of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,
11775: he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
11776: He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
11777: a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
11778: absence. He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his
11779: testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal
11780: in the eyes of the Republic?
11781: 
11782: The populace cried enthusiastically, "No!" and the President rang his
11783: bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry "No!"
11784: until they left off, of their own will.
11785: 
11786: The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained
11787: that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence
11788: to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,
11789: but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
11790: the President.
11791: 
11792: The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
11793: it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
11794: and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
11795: Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
11796: pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of
11797: enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
11798: overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
11799: of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
11800: had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's
11801: declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
11802: answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,
11803: called Darnay.
11804: 
11805: Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
11806: and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he
11807: proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his
11808: release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
11809: England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
11810: their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat
11811: government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
11812: the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these
11813: circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the
11814: straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
11815: populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur
11816: Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
11817: had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his
11818: account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
11819: they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
11820: receive them.
11821: 
11822: At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace
11823: set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's
11824: favour, and the President declared him free.
11825: 
11826: Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
11827: sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
11828: generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
11829: their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of
11830: these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
11831: to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
11832: was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
11833: at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
11834: prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after
11835: his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
11836: exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
11837: people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with
11838: the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
11839: streets.
11840: 
11841: His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
11842: rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried
11843: together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not
11844: assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate
11845: itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
11846: him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
11847: hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign
11848: of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, "Long live the
11849: Republic!"
11850: 
11851: The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
11852: for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
11853: crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
11854: Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the
11855: concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
11856: turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
11857: which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
11858: shore.
11859: 
11860: They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
11861: taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
11862: Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they
11863: had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not
11864: even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
11865: on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,
11866: and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
11867: he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he
11868: was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.
11869: 
11870: In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
11871: him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
11872: prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
11873: they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried
11874: him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father
11875: had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his
11876: feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.
11877: 
11878: As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
11879: face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come
11880: together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the
11881: rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
11882: Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
11883: crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
11884: overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank,
11885: and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
11886: them away.
11887: 
11888: After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud
11889: before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
11890: breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
11891: after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
11892: his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who
11893: lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their
11894: rooms.
11895: 
11896: "Lucie! My own! I am safe."
11897: 
11898: "O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
11899: prayed to Him."
11900: 
11901: They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in
11902: his arms, he said to her:
11903: 
11904: "And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France
11905: could have done what he has done for me."
11906: 
11907: She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor
11908: head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he
11909: had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his
11910: strength. "You must not be weak, my darling," he remonstrated; "don't
11911: tremble so. I have saved him."
11912: 
11913: 
11914: 
11915: 
11916: VII. A Knock at the Door
11917: 
11918: 
11919: "I have saved him." It was not another of the dreams in which he had
11920: often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
11921: vague but heavy fear was upon her.
11922: 
11923: All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately
11924: revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on
11925: vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
11926: many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
11927: her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
11928: heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
11929: The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
11930: the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
11931: them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to
11932: his real presence and trembled more.
11933: 
11934: Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
11935: woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,
11936: no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task
11937: he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let
11938: them all lean upon him.
11939: 
11940: Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
11941: the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
11942: because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
11943: had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
11944: the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and
11945: partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and
11946: citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
11947: occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by
11948: Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
11949: night.
11950: 
11951: It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
11952: Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
11953: house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
11954: of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
11955: Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
11956: below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
11957: himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had
11958: employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
11959: Darnay.
11960: 
11961: In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
11962: harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor's little household, as
11963: in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
11964: were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
11965: shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
11966: possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
11967: 
11968: For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
11969: office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
11970: basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
11971: lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
11972: such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long
11973: association with a French family, might have known as much of their
11974: language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
11975: direction; consequently she knew no more of that "nonsense" (as she was
11976: pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing
11977: was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
11978: introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
11979: the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
11980: of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always
11981: made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
11982: one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.
11983: 
11984: "Now, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
11985: "if you are ready, I am."
11986: 
11987: Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He had worn
11988: all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.
11989: 
11990: "There's all manner of things wanted," said Miss Pross, "and we shall
11991: have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts
11992: these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it."
11993: 
11994: "It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,"
11995: retorted Jerry, "whether they drink your health or the Old Un's."
11996: 
11997: "Who's he?" said Miss Pross.
11998: 
11999: Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning "Old
12000: Nick's."
12001: 
12002: "Ha!" said Miss Pross, "it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the
12003: meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder,
12004: and Mischief."
12005: 
12006: "Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!" cried Lucie.
12007: 
12008: "Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious," said Miss Pross; "but I may say
12009: among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
12010: smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the
12011: streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
12012: Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your
12013: pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
12014: May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?"
12015: 
12016: "I think you may take that liberty," the Doctor answered, smiling.
12017: 
12018: "For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
12019: that," said Miss Pross.
12020: 
12021: "Hush, dear! Again?" Lucie remonstrated.
12022: 
12023: "Well, my sweet," said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, "the
12024: short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious
12025: Majesty King George the Third;" Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; "and
12026: as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
12027: tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!"
12028: 
12029: Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
12030: after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.
12031: 
12032: "I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you
12033: had never taken that cold in your voice," said Miss Pross, approvingly.
12034: "But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there"--it was the good creature's
12035: way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
12036: with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--"is there any
12037: prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?"
12038: 
12039: "I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet."
12040: 
12041: "Heigh-ho-hum!" said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
12042: glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, "then we
12043: must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and
12044: fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't
12045: you move, Ladybird!"
12046: 
12047: They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
12048: child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
12049: Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
12050: a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
12051: sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
12052: in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
12053: a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
12054: a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
12055: quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.
12056: 
12057: "What is that?" she cried, all at once.
12058: 
12059: "My dear!" said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand
12060: on hers, "command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The
12061: least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father's daughter!"
12062: 
12063: "I thought, my father," said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
12064: and in a faltering voice, "that I heard strange feet upon the stairs."
12065: 
12066: "My love, the staircase is as still as Death."
12067: 
12068: As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
12069: 
12070: "Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!"
12071: 
12072: "My child," said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
12073: shoulder, "I _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go
12074: to the door."
12075: 
12076: He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,
12077: and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough
12078: men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.
12079: 
12080: "The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay," said the first.
12081: 
12082: "Who seeks him?" answered Darnay.
12083: 
12084: "I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
12085: Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic."
12086: 
12087: The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
12088: to him.
12089: 
12090: "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?"
12091: 
12092: "It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
12093: know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow."
12094: 
12095: Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
12096: stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,
12097: moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
12098: the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
12099: woollen shirt, said:
12100: 
12101: "You know him, you have said. Do you know me?"
12102: 
12103: "Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor."
12104: 
12105: "We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three.
12106: 
12107: He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
12108: after a pause:
12109: 
12110: "Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?"
12111: 
12112: "Citizen Doctor," said the first, reluctantly, "he has been denounced to
12113: the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen," pointing out the second who
12114: had entered, "is from Saint Antoine."
12115: 
12116: The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:
12117: 
12118: "He is accused by Saint Antoine."
12119: 
12120: "Of what?" asked the Doctor.
12121: 
12122: "Citizen Doctor," said the first, with his former reluctance, "ask no
12123: more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
12124: a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.
12125: The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed."
12126: 
12127: "One word," the Doctor entreated. "Will you tell me who denounced him?"
12128: 
12129: "It is against rule," answered the first; "but you can ask Him of Saint
12130: Antoine here."
12131: 
12132: The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his
12133: feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:
12134: 
12135: "Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by
12136: the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other."
12137: 
12138: "What other?"
12139: 
12140: "Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?"
12141: 
12142: "Yes."
12143: 
12144: "Then," said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, "you will be
12145: answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!"
12146: 
12147: 
12148: 
12149: 
12150: VIII. A Hand at Cards
12151: 
12152: 
12153: Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
12154: way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
12155: Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
12156: she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They
12157: both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
12158: passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
12159: turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It
12160: was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
12161: lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
12162: stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
12163: Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
12164: undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never
12165: grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.
12166: 
12167: Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
12168: for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
12169: After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
12170: Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
12171: once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
12172: took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same
12173: description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
12174: not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her
12175: opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
12176: attended by her cavalier.
12177: 
12178: Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
12179: playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
12180: bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
12181: the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
12182: resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the
12183: popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
12184: like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
12185: the counter, and showed what they wanted.
12186: 
12187: As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
12188: corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
12189: sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
12190: her hands.
12191: 
12192: In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was
12193: assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
12194: likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
12195: saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
12196: the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,
12197: evidently English.
12198: 
12199: What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
12200: Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
12201: voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
12202: Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
12203: ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
12204: not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
12205: Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
12206: account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.
12207: 
12208: "What is the matter?" said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
12209: speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
12210: English.
12211: 
12212: "Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!" cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.
12213: "After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
12214: do I find you here!"
12215: 
12216: "Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?" asked the
12217: man, in a furtive, frightened way.
12218: 
12219: "Brother, brother!" cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. "Have I ever
12220: been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?"
12221: 
12222: "Then hold your meddlesome tongue," said Solomon, "and come out, if you
12223: want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?"
12224: 
12225: Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
12226: affectionate brother, said through her tears, "Mr. Cruncher."
12227: 
12228: "Let him come out too," said Solomon. "Does he think me a ghost?"
12229: 
12230: Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a
12231: word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
12232: through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did
12233: so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus
12234: of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
12235: language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
12236: pursuits.
12237: 
12238: "Now," said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, "what do you
12239: want?"
12240: 
12241: "How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
12242: from!" cried Miss Pross, "to give me such a greeting, and show me no
12243: affection."
12244: 
12245: "There. Confound it! There," said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's
12246: lips with his own. "Now are you content?"
12247: 
12248: Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.
12249: 
12250: "If you expect me to be surprised," said her brother Solomon, "I am not
12251: surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If
12252: you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
12253: do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I
12254: am an official."
12255: 
12256: "My English brother Solomon," mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
12257: tear-fraught eyes, "that had the makings in him of one of the best and
12258: greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
12259: such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
12260: his--"
12261: 
12262: "I said so!" cried her brother, interrupting. "I knew it. You want to be
12263: the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just
12264: as I am getting on!"
12265: 
12266: "The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!" cried Miss Pross. "Far
12267: rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
12268: loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
12269: and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
12270: detain you no longer."
12271: 
12272: Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any
12273: culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years
12274: ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
12275: her money and left her!
12276: 
12277: He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging
12278: condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
12279: merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,
12280: all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,
12281: hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
12282: question:
12283: 
12284: "I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,
12285: or Solomon John?"
12286: 
12287: The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
12288: previously uttered a word.
12289: 
12290: "Come!" said Mr. Cruncher. "Speak out, you know." (Which, by the way,
12291: was more than he could do himself.) "John Solomon, or Solomon John? She
12292: calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know
12293: you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that
12294: name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water."
12295: 
12296: "What do you mean?"
12297: 
12298: "Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name
12299: was, over the water."
12300: 
12301: "No?"
12302: 
12303: "No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables."
12304: 
12305: "Indeed?"
12306: 
12307: "Yes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness
12308: at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to
12309: yourself, was you called at that time?"
12310: 
12311: "Barsad," said another voice, striking in.
12312: 
12313: "That's the name for a thousand pound!" cried Jerry.
12314: 
12316: him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's
12317: elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.
12318: 
12319: "Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his
12320: surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
12321: elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
12322: myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a
12323: better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
12324: was not a Sheep of the Prisons."
12325: 
12326: Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,
12327: who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--
12328: 
12329: "I'll tell you," said Sydney. "I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
12330: of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,
12331: an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember
12332: faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
12333: a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
12334: the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
12335: direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and
12336: sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
12337: conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
12338: nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
12339: to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad."
12340: 
12341: "What purpose?" the spy asked.
12342: 
12343: "It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the
12344: street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
12345: company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?"
12346: 
12347: "Under a threat?"
12348: 
12349: "Oh! Did I say that?"
12350: 
12351: "Then, why should I go there?"
12352: 
12353: "Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't."
12354: 
12355: "Do you mean that you won't say, sir?" the spy irresolutely asked.
12356: 
12357: "You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't."
12358: 
12359: Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
12360: quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
12361: and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
12362: made the most of it.
12363: 
12364: "Now, I told you so," said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
12365: sister; "if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing."
12366: 
12367: "Come, come, Mr. Barsad!" exclaimed Sydney. "Don't be ungrateful.
12368: But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
12369: pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
12370: satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?"
12371: 
12372: "I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you."
12373: 
12374: "I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
12375: own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,
12376: at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
12377: knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we
12378: ready? Come then!"
12379: 
12380: Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
12381: remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up
12382: in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced
12383: purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
12384: contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was
12385: too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
12386: her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to
12387: heed what she observed.
12388: 
12389: They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.
12390: Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon
12391: Pross, walked at his side.
12392: 
12393: Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
12394: little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the
12395: picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked
12396: into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
12397: ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
12398: which he saw a stranger.
12399: 
12400: "Miss Pross's brother, sir," said Sydney. "Mr. Barsad."
12401: 
12402: "Barsad?" repeated the old gentleman, "Barsad? I have an association
12403: with the name--and with the face."
12404: 
12405: "I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad," observed Carton,
12406: coolly. "Pray sit down."
12407: 
12408: As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
12409: by saying to him with a frown, "Witness at that trial." Mr. Lorry
12410: immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
12411: look of abhorrence.
12412: 
12413: "Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
12414: brother you have heard of," said Sydney, "and has acknowledged the
12415: relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again."
12416: 
12417: Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, "What do you
12418: tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about
12419: to return to him!"
12420: 
12421: "Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?"
12422: 
12423: "Just now, if at all."
12424: 
12425: "Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir," said Sydney, "and I
12426: have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep
12427: over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the
12428: messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
12429: earthly doubt that he is retaken."
12430: 
12431: Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss
12432: of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
12433: might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
12434: silently attentive.
12435: 
12436: "Now, I trust," said Sydney to him, "that the name and influence of
12437: Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he
12438: would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--"
12439: 
12440: "Yes; I believe so."
12441: 
12442: "--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own
12443: to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the
12444: power to prevent this arrest."
12445: 
12446: "He may not have known of it beforehand," said Mr. Lorry.
12447: 
12448: "But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
12449: identified he is with his son-in-law."
12450: 
12451: "That's true," Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
12452: chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.
12453: 
12454: "In short," said Sydney, "this is a desperate time, when desperate games
12455: are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I
12456: will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one
12457: carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the
12458: stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
12459: in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
12460: Barsad."
12461: 
12462: "You need have good cards, sir," said the spy.
12463: 
12464: "I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a
12465: brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy."
12466: 
12467: It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another
12468: glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.
12469: 
12470: "Mr. Barsad," he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
12471: over a hand at cards: "Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
12472: committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
12473: so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
12474: is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
12475: Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.
12476: That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
12477: French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
12478: English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent
12479: card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
12480: Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
12481: spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
12482: the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
12483: difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my
12484: hand, Mr. Barsad?"
12485: 
12486: "Not to understand your play," returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.
12487: 
12488: "I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
12489: Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't
12490: hurry."
12491: 
12492: He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
12493: drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
12494: into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he
12495: poured out and drank another glassful.
12496: 
12497: "Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time."
12498: 
12499: It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
12501: employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
12502: there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for
12503: vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
12504: date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
12505: France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
12506: there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He
12507: knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint
12508: Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
12509: such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,
12510: release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
12511: familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
12512: Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered
12513: with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
12514: talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
12515: He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
12516: again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the
12517: guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as
12518: he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
12519: he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of
12520: his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
12521: terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such
12522: grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw
12523: that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
12524: proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash
12525: his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon
12526: terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
12527: the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
12528: 
12529: "You scarcely seem to like your hand," said Sydney, with the greatest
12530: composure. "Do you play?"
12531: 
12532: "I think, sir," said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.
12533: Lorry, "I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
12534: put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
12535: under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace
12536: of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
12537: considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
12538: somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean
12539: himself as to make himself one?"
12540: 
12541: "I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad," said Carton, taking the answer on himself,
12542: and looking at his watch, "without any scruple, in a very few minutes."
12543: 
12544: "I should have hoped, gentlemen both," said the spy, always striving to
12545: hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, "that your respect for my sister--"
12546: 
12547: "I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
12549: 
12550: "You think not, sir?"
12551: 
12552: "I have thoroughly made up my mind about it."
12553: 
12554: The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his
12555: ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
12556: received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
12557: mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
12558: failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air
12559: of contemplating cards:
12560: 
12561: "And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I
12562: have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
12563: fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
12564: who was he?"
12565: 
12566: "French. You don't know him," said the spy, quickly.
12567: 
12568: "French, eh?" repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
12569: at all, though he echoed his word. "Well; he may be."
12570: 
12571: "Is, I assure you," said the spy; "though it's not important."
12572: 
12573: "Though it's not important," repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
12574: way--"though it's not important--No, it's not important. No. Yet I know
12575: the face."
12576: 
12577: "I think not. I am sure not. It can't be," said the spy.
12578: 
12580: glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. "Can't-be. Spoke good
12581: French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?"
12582: 
12583: "Provincial," said the spy.
12584: 
12585: "No. Foreign!" cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a
12586: light broke clearly on his mind. "Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We
12587: had that man before us at the Old Bailey."
12588: 
12589: "Now, there you are hasty, sir," said Barsad, with a smile that gave his
12590: aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; "there you really give
12591: me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
12592: distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
12593: attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church
12594: of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
12595: multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped
12596: to lay him in his coffin."
12597: 
12598: Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable
12599: goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it
12600: to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
12601: risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.
12602: 
12603: "Let us be reasonable," said the spy, "and let us be fair. To show you
12604: how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
12605: lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have
12606: carried in my pocket-book," with a hurried hand he produced and opened
12607: it, "ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take
12608: it in your hand; it's no forgery."
12609: 
12610: Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
12611: Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more
12612: violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the
12613: crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.
12614: 
12615: Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on
12616: the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.
12617: 
12618: "That there Roger Cly, master," said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and
12619: iron-bound visage. "So _you_ put him in his coffin?"
12620: 
12621: "I did."
12622: 
12623: "Who took him out of it?"
12624: 
12625: Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, "What do you mean?"
12626: 
12627: "I mean," said Mr. Cruncher, "that he warn't never in it. No! Not he!
12628: I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it."
12629: 
12630: The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
12631: unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.
12632: 
12633: "I tell you," said Jerry, "that you buried paving-stones and earth in
12634: that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a
12635: take in. Me and two more knows it."
12636: 
12637: "How do you know it?"
12638: 
12639: "What's that to you? Ecod!" growled Mr. Cruncher, "it's you I have got a
12640: old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
12641: I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea."
12642: 
12643: Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
12644: this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
12645: explain himself.
12646: 
12647: "At another time, sir," he returned, evasively, "the present time is
12648: ill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
12649: wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
12650: in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his
12651: throat and choke him for half a guinea;" Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
12652: quite a liberal offer; "or I'll out and announce him."
12653: 
12654: "Humph! I see one thing," said Carton. "I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.
12655: Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for
12656: you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
12657: aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
12658: the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
12659: A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong
12660: card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?"
12661: 
12662: "No!" returned the spy. "I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular
12663: with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk
12664: of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
12665: he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this
12666: man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me."
12667: 
12668: "Never you trouble your head about this man," retorted the contentious
12669: Mr. Cruncher; "you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
12670: that gentleman. And look here! Once more!"--Mr. Cruncher could not
12671: be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
12672: liberality--"I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
12673: guinea."
12674: 
12676: with more decision, "It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
12677: can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
12678: Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
12679: office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
12680: life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
12681: I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
12682: here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
12683: way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
12684: me?"
12685: 
12686: "Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?"
12687: 
12688: "I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,"
12689: said the spy, firmly.
12690: 
12691: "Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the
12692: Conciergerie?"
12693: 
12694: "I am sometimes."
12695: 
12696: "You can be when you choose?"
12697: 
12698: "I can pass in and out when I choose."
12699: 
12700: Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
12701: upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he
12702: said, rising:
12703: 
12704: "So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
12705: the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come
12706: into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone."
12707: 
12708: 
12709: 
12710: 
12711: IX. The Game Made
12712: 
12713: 
12715: dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
12716: at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's
12717: manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the
12718: leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,
12719: and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very
12720: questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught
12721: his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
12722: hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
12723: infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.
12724: 
12725: "Jerry," said Mr. Lorry. "Come here."
12726: 
12727: Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance
12728: of him.
12729: 
12730: "What have you been, besides a messenger?"
12731: 
12732: After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,
12733: Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, "Agicultooral
12734: character."
12735: 
12736: "My mind misgives me much," said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger
12737: at him, "that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's
12738: as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
12739: description. If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you
12740: get back to England. If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret.
12741: Tellson's shall not be imposed upon."
12742: 
12743: "I hope, sir," pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, "that a gentleman like
12744: yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
12745: would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
12746: is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
12747: it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. There'd be two sides
12748: to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
12749: up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his
12750: fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor
12751: yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
12752: their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
12753: out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.
12754: Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the
12755: goose and not the gander. And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
12756: in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
12757: a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
12758: ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at
12759: it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
12760: and how can you rightly have one without t'other? Then, wot with
12761: undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
12762: with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get
12763: much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never
12764: prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He'd never have no good of it; he'd want
12765: all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being
12766: once in--even if it wos so."
12767: 
12768: "Ugh!" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, "I am shocked at
12769: the sight of you."
12770: 
12771: "Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr. Cruncher,
12772: "even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--"
12773: 
12774: "Don't prevaricate," said Mr. Lorry.
12775: 
12776: "No, I will _not_, sir," returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
12777: further from his thoughts or practice--"which I don't say it is--wot I
12778: would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at
12779: that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
12780: be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
12781: your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it
12782: wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
12783: you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of
12784: his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and
12785: let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends
12786: for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of 'em in with
12787: a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe.
12788: That, Mr. Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his
12789: arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
12790: discourse, "is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't
12791: see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects
12792: without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
12793: to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of
12794: things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you
12795: fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good
12796: cause when I might have kep' it back."
12797: 
12798: "That at least is true," said Mr. Lorry. "Say no more now. It may be
12799: that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
12800: action--not in words. I want no more words."
12801: 
12803: returned from the dark room. "Adieu, Mr. Barsad," said the former; "our
12804: arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."
12805: 
12806: He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they
12807: were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?
12808: 
12809: "Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
12810: to him, once."
12811: 
12812: Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.
12813: 
12814: "It is all I could do," said Carton. "To propose too much, would be
12815: to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
12816: worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the
12817: weakness of the position. There is no help for it."
12818: 
12819: "But access to him," said Mr. Lorry, "if it should go ill before the
12820: Tribunal, will not save him."
12821: 
12822: "I never said it would."
12823: 
12824: Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
12825: darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
12826: weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
12827: and his tears fell.
12828: 
12829: "You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered
12830: voice. "Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my
12831: father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
12832: sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
12833: however."
12834: 
12835: Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there
12836: was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
12837: that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
12838: unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.
12839: 
12840: "To return to poor Darnay," said Carton. "Don't tell Her of this
12841: interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
12842: him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
12843: to him the means of anticipating the sentence."
12844: 
12845: Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to
12846: see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
12847: evidently understood it.
12848: 
12849: "She might think a thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them would
12850: only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when
12851: I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any
12852: little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
12853: You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night."
12854: 
12855: "I am going now, directly."
12856: 
12857: "I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
12858: on you. How does she look?"
12859: 
12860: "Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."
12861: 
12862: "Ah!"
12863: 
12864: It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It
12865: attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
12866: fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
12867: passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
12868: wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
12869: flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
12870: and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
12871: light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
12872: all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was
12873: sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
12874: his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
12875: broken under the weight of his foot.
12876: 
12877: "I forgot it," he said.
12878: 
12879: Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the
12880: wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
12881: the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
12882: reminded of that expression.
12883: 
12884: "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?" said Carton, turning
12885: to him.
12886: 
12887: "Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
12888: unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
12889: have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have
12890: my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go."
12891: 
12892: They were both silent.
12893: 
12894: "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?" said Carton, wistfully.
12895: 
12896: "I am in my seventy-eighth year."
12897: 
12898: "You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
12899: trusted, respected, and looked up to?"
12900: 
12901: "I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I
12902: may say that I was a man of business when a boy."
12903: 
12904: "See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss
12905: you when you leave it empty!"
12906: 
12907: "A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. "There
12908: is nobody to weep for me."
12909: 
12910: "How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?"
12911: 
12912: "Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said."
12913: 
12914: "It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?"
12915: 
12916: "Surely, surely."
12917: 
12918: "If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
12919: 'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
12920: respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
12921: regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!'
12922: your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
12923: not?"
12924: 
12925: "You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be."
12926: 
12927: Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
12928: few moments, said:
12929: 
12930: "I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
12931: days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?"
12932: 
12933: Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:
12934: 
12935: "Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
12936: closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
12937: nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
12938: preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
12939: that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),
12940: and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not
12941: so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me."
12942: 
12943: "I understand the feeling!" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. "And
12944: you are the better for it?"
12945: 
12946: "I hope so."
12947: 
12948: Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with
12949: his outer coat; "But you," said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, "you
12950: are young."
12951: 
12952: "Yes," said Carton. "I am not old, but my young way was never the way to
12953: age. Enough of me."
12954: 
12955: "And of me, I am sure," said Mr. Lorry. "Are you going out?"
12956: 
12957: "I'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
12958: habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
12959: uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?"
12960: 
12961: "Yes, unhappily."
12962: 
12963: "I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
12964: place for me. Take my arm, sir."
12965: 
12966: Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A
12967: few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him
12968: there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
12969: again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
12970: the prison every day. "She came out here," he said, looking about him,
12971: "turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
12972: her steps."
12973: 
12974: It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,
12975: where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having
12976: closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
12977: 
12979: man eyed him inquisitively.
12980: 
12981: "Good night, citizen."
12982: 
12983: "How goes the Republic?"
12984: 
12985: "You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount
12986: to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being
12987: exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!"
12988: 
12989: "Do you often go to see him--"
12990: 
12991: "Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?"
12992: 
12993: "Never."
12994: 
12995: "Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
12996: citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
12997: than two pipes. Word of honour!"
12998: 
12999: As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain
13000: how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
13001: to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.
13002: 
13003: "But you are not English," said the wood-sawyer, "though you wear
13004: English dress?"
13005: 
13006: "Yes," said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
13007: 
13008: "You speak like a Frenchman."
13009: 
13010: "I am an old student here."
13011: 
13012: "Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman."
13013: 
13014: "Good night, citizen."
13015: 
13016: "But go and see that droll dog," the little man persisted, calling after
13017: him. "And take a pipe with you!"
13018: 
13019: Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of
13020: the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
13021: of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
13022: the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
13023: for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
13024: terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with
13025: his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
13026: thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
13027: 
13028: Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
13029: counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. "Whew!" the chemist
13030: whistled softly, as he read it. "Hi! hi! hi!"
13031: 
13032: Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:
13033: 
13034: "For you, citizen?"
13035: 
13036: "For me."
13037: 
13038: "You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
13039: consequences of mixing them?"
13040: 
13041: "Perfectly."
13042: 
13043: Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by
13044: one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,
13045: and deliberately left the shop. "There is nothing more to do," said he,
13046: glancing upward at the moon, "until to-morrow. I can't sleep."
13047: 
13048: It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words
13049: aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
13050: negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
13051: had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
13052: his road and saw its end.
13053: 
13054: Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
13055: youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His
13056: mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been
13057: read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark
13058: streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
13059: on high above him. "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
13060: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
13061: whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."
13062: 
13063: In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
13064: rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
13065: and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
13066: and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that
13067: brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep,
13068: might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and
13069: went on.
13070: 
13071: With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
13072: going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
13073: surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers
13074: were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
13075: of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and
13076: profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
13077: the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
13078: along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
13079: material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among
13080: the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn
13081: interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
13083: the lighter streets.
13084: 
13085: Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
13086: suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
13087: shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the
13088: people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At
13089: one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
13090: for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,
13091: and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
13092: 
13093: "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
13094: in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
13095: believeth in me, shall never die."
13096: 
13097: Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
13098: were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm
13099: and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
13100: heard them always.
13101: 
13102: The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
13103: water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
13104: picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
13105: of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the
13106: sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,
13107: and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to
13108: Death's dominion.
13109: 
13110: But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden
13111: of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.
13112: And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light
13113: appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
13114: sparkled under it.
13115: 
13116: The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
13117: friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the
13118: houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
13119: bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little
13120: longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the
13121: stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--"Like me."
13122: 
13123: A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
13124: glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track
13125: in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
13126: for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
13127: ended in the words, "I am the resurrection and the life."
13128: 
13129: Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
13131: little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
13132: himself, went out to the place of trial.
13133: 
13134: The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
13135: away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
13136: Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,
13137: sitting beside her father.
13138: 
13139: When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
13140: sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
13141: tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
13142: blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If
13143: there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney
13144: Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.
13145: 
13146: Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
13147: ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have
13148: been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not
13149: first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
13150: Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.
13151: 
13152: Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good
13153: republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day
13154: after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and
13155: his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance
13156: gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
13157: cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.
13158: Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.
13159: 
13160: Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
13161: No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
13162: murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye
13163: in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one
13164: another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
13165: 
13166: Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and
13167: retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and
13168: Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,
13169: one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
13170: privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
13171: called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.
13172: 
13173: To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.
13174: 
13175: The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?
13176: 
13177: "Openly, President."
13178: 
13179: "By whom?"
13180: 
13181: "Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine."
13182: 
13183: "Good."
13184: 
13185: "Therese Defarge, his wife."
13186: 
13187: "Good."
13188: 
13189: "Alexandre Manette, physician."
13190: 
13191: A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor
13192: Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
13193: 
13194: "President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
13195: a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
13196: daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who
13197: and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
13198: of my child!"
13199: 
13200: "Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of
13201: the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer
13202: to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
13203: Republic."
13204: 
13205: Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and
13206: with warmth resumed.
13207: 
13208: "If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
13209: herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is
13210: to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!"
13211: 
13212: Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with
13213: his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
13214: closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
13215: and restored the usual hand to his mouth.
13216: 
13217: Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
13218: being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
13219: his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release,
13220: and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
13221: This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.
13222: 
13223: "You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?"
13224: 
13225: "I believe so."
13226: 
13227: Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: "You were one of the
13228: best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day
13229: there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
13230: it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!"
13231: 
13232: It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,
13233: thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The
13234: Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, "I defy that bell!"
13235: wherein she was likewise much commended.
13236: 
13237: "Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
13238: citizen."
13239: 
13240: "I knew," said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
13241: bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
13242: "I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
13243: known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He
13244: knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,
13245: when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,
13246: when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to
13247: the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
13248: gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a
13249: stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is
13250: that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens
13251: of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
13252: I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
13253: the President."
13254: 
13255: "Let it be read."
13256: 
13257: In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking
13258: lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
13259: solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
13260: reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge
13261: never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there
13262: intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as
13263: follows.
13264: 
13265: 
13266: 
13267: 
13268: X. The Substance of the Shadow
13269: 
13270: 
13271: "I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
13272: afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
13273: cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write
13274: it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it
13275: in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
13276: place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
13277: and my sorrows are dust.
13278: 
13279: "These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with
13280: difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed
13281: with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope
13282: has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have
13283: noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I
13284: solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
13285: mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the
13286: truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they
13287: be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.
13288: 
13289: "One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the
13290: twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired
13291: part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,
13292: at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the
13293: School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very
13294: fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it
13295: might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a
13296: voice called to the driver to stop.
13297: 
13298: "The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
13299: and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
13300: was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
13301: door and alight before I came up with it.
13302: 
13303: "I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
13304: conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
13305: I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
13306: younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
13307: and (as far as I could see) face too.
13308: 
13309: "'You are Doctor Manette?' said one.
13310: 
13311: "I am."
13312: 
13313: "'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young
13314: physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
13315: has made a rising reputation in Paris?'
13316: 
13317: "'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so
13318: graciously.'
13319: 
13320: "'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being
13321: so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
13322: probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
13323: overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?'
13324: 
13325: "The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
13326: were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
13327: They were armed. I was not.
13328: 
13329: "'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
13330: the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
13331: which I am summoned.'
13332: 
13333: "The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor,
13334: your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
13335: our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
13336: yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
13337: enter the carriage?'
13338: 
13339: "I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both
13340: entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The
13341: carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
13342: 
13343: "I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that
13344: it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took
13345: place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make
13346: the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my
13347: paper in its hiding-place.
13348: 
13349:         *****
13350: 
13351: "The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
13352: emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
13353: Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
13354: when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
13355: stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by
13356: a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
13357: overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
13358: answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
13359: the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.
13360: 
13361: "There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
13362: for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the
13363: other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
13364: with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
13365: alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.
13366: 
13367: "From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
13368: locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had
13369: relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was
13370: conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
13371: ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
13372: lying on a bed.
13373: 
13374: "The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much
13375: past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to
13376: her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were
13377: all portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them, which was a fringed
13378: scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,
13379: and the letter E.
13380: 
13381: "I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;
13382: for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
13383: edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was
13384: in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve
13385: her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the
13386: corner caught my sight.
13387: 
13388: "I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
13389: and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and
13390: wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
13391: words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up to
13392: twelve, and said, 'Hush!' For an instant, and no more, she would pause
13393: to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she
13394: would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and
13395: would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!' There was no variation in the
13396: order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment's
13397: pause, in the utterance of these sounds.
13398: 
13399: "'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?'
13400: 
13401: "To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
13402: younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It
13403: was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.'
13404: 
13405: "'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'
13406: 
13407: "'A brother.'
13408: 
13409: "'I do not address her brother?'
13410: 
13411: "He answered with great contempt, 'No.'
13412: 
13413: "'She has some recent association with the number twelve?'
13414: 
13415: "The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?'
13416: 
13417: "'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how
13418: useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming
13419: to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There
13420: are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'
13421: 
13422: "The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is
13423: a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on
13424: the table.
13425: 
13426:         *****
13427: 
13428: "I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my
13429: lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
13430: poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
13431: 
13432: "'Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.
13433: 
13434: "'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no
13435: more.
13436: 
13437: "I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
13438: efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it
13439: after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then
13440: sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman
13441: in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into
13442: a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
13443: furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick
13444: old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the
13445: sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular
13446: succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' the
13447: counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had
13448: not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to
13449: them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement
13450: in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much
13451: soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
13452: figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more
13453: regular.
13454: 
13455: "For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
13456: the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
13457: before the elder said:
13458: 
13459: "'There is another patient.'
13460: 
13461: "I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?'
13462: 
13463: "'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
13464: 
13465:         *****
13466: 
13467: "The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
13468: was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling
13469: to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
13470: there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
13471: the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to
13472: pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial
13473: and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
13474: this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
13475: captivity, as I saw them all that night.
13476: 
13477: "On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a
13478: handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
13479: He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his
13480: breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
13481: where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see
13482: that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.
13483: 
13484: "'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. 'Let me examine it.'
13485: 
13486: "'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.'
13487: 
13488: "It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.
13489: The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours
13490: before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
13491: without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder
13492: brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
13493: ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all
13494: as if he were a fellow-creature.
13495: 
13496: "'How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.
13497: 
13498: "'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him,
13499: and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.'
13500: 
13501: "There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
13502: answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
13503: have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would
13504: have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
13505: vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
13506: the boy, or about his fate.
13507: 
13508: "The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now
13509: slowly moved to me.
13510: 
13511: "'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are
13512: proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but
13513: we have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?'
13514: 
13515: "The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
13516: distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.
13517: 
13518: "I said, 'I have seen her.'
13519: 
13520: "'She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
13521: Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
13522: have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
13523: so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a
13524: tenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that man's who stands there.
13525: The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.'
13526: 
13527: "It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
13528: to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
13529: 
13530: "'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
13531: are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to
13532: work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged
13533: to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
13534: for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
13535: plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
13536: ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his
13537: people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
13538: and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
13539: dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
13540: most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
13541: race die out!'
13542: 
13543: "I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
13544: like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
13545: somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
13546: dying boy.
13547: 
13548: "'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time,
13549: poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort
13550: him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not
13551: been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired
13552: her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among
13553: us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and
13554: hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two
13555: then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her
13556: willing?'
13557: 
13558: "The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the
13559: looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two
13560: opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this
13561: Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all
13562: trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.
13563: 
13564: "'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
13565: harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and
13566: drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their
13567: grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
13568: may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
13569: night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was
13570: not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he
13571: could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
13572: bell, and died on her bosom.'
13573: 
13574: "Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
13575: tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
13576: he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his
13577: wound.
13578: 
13579: "'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his
13580: brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his
13581: brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
13582: it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,
13583: for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the
13584: tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words
13585: that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place
13586: beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be
13587: _his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed
13588: in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was
13589: somewhere here?'
13590: 
13591: "The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around
13592: him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
13593: over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.
13594: 
13595: "'She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was
13596: dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck
13597: at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to
13598: make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword
13599: that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust
13600: at me with all his skill for his life.'
13601: 
13602: "My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
13603: a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman's. In
13604: another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.
13605: 
13606: "'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'
13607: 
13608: "'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
13609: referred to the brother.
13610: 
13611: "'He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the
13612: man who was here? Turn my face to him.'
13613: 
13614: "I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for the
13615: moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging
13616: me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.
13617: 
13618: "'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and
13619: his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to be
13620: answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
13621: answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that
13622: I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
13623: I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them
13624: separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do
13625: it.'
13626: 
13627: "Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
13628: forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the
13629: finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him
13630: down dead.
13631: 
13632:         *****
13633: 
13634: "When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving
13635: in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last
13636: for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
13637: grave.
13638: 
13639: "I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
13640: the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing
13641: quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
13642: of her words. They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother!
13643: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
13644: twelve. Hush!'
13645: 
13646: "This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had
13647: come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to
13648: falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
13649: by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
13650: 
13651: "It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
13652: fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to
13653: compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew
13654: her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
13655: a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had
13656: had of her.
13657: 
13658: "'Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
13659: elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.
13660: 
13661: "'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.'
13662: 
13663: "'What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking down
13664: at her with some curiosity.
13665: 
13666: "'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and
13667: despair.'
13668: 
13669: "He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a
13670: chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a
13671: subdued voice,
13672: 
13673: "'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
13674: recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,
13675: and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
13676: of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
13677: and not spoken of.'
13678: 
13679: "I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.
13680: 
13681: "'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'
13682: 
13683: "'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients
13684: are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I
13685: was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
13686: 
13687: "Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
13688: pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
13689: resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.
13690: 
13691:         *****
13692: 
13693: "I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
13694: fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
13695: darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or
13696: failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that
13697: was ever spoken between me and those brothers.
13698: 
13699: "She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few
13700: syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She
13701: asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It
13702: was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her
13703: head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.
13704: 
13705: "I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
13706: brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until
13707: then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
13708: woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
13709: the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
13710: that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as
13711: if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.
13712: 
13713: "I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
13714: brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
13715: peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
13716: of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
13717: to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
13718: brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
13719: for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to
13720: me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance
13721: in the mind of the elder, too.
13722: 
13723: "My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,
13724: answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone
13725: with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and
13726: all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.
13727: 
13728: "The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
13729: away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
13730: their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
13731: 
13732: "'At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.
13733: 
13734: "'She is dead,' said I.
13735: 
13736: "'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round.
13737: 
13738: "He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now
13739: gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on
13740: the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
13741: nothing.
13742: 
13743: "'Pray excuse me,' said I. 'Under the circumstances, no.'
13744: 
13745: "They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to
13746: them, and we parted without another word on either side.
13747: 
13748:         *****
13749: 
13750: "I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I
13751: have written with this gaunt hand.
13752: 
13753: "Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
13754: little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
13755: considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
13756: to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
13757: summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
13758: circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
13759: of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
13760: heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a
13761: profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
13762: in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
13763: I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
13764: compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
13765: 
13766: "I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
13767: night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.
13768: It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just
13769: completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.
13770: 
13771:         *****
13772: 
13773: "I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is
13774: so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so
13775: dreadful.
13776: 
13777: "The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
13778: life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
13779: wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
13780: boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
13781: on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
13782: had seen that nobleman very lately.
13783: 
13784: "My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
13785: conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I
13786: know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and
13787: in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's
13788: share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl
13789: was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her,
13790: in secret, a woman's sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
13791: Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
13792: 
13793: "She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and
13794: her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing
13795: but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her
13796: inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope
13797: that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
13798: wretched hour I am ignorant of both.
13799:

13801: 
13802: "These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,
13803: yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.
13804: 
13805: "She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How
13806: could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence
13807: was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her
13808: husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a
13809: pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.
13810: 
13811: "'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do
13812: all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his
13813: inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent
13814: atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What
13815: I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few
13816: jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the
13817: compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if
13818: the sister can be discovered.'
13819: 
13820: "She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear
13821: sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her
13822: bravely, 'Yes!' I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
13823: went away caressing him. I never saw her more.
13824: 
13825: "As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it,
13826: I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
13827: trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
13828: 
13829: "That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in
13830: a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed
13831: my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came
13832: into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
13833: My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at
13834: the gate, standing silent behind him.
13835: 
13836: "An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me,
13837: he had a coach in waiting.
13838: 
13839: "It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the
13840: house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and
13841: my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark
13842: corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from
13843: his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light
13844: of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.
13845: Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living
13846: grave.

13848: "If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the
13849: brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
13850: my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
13851: dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But,
13852: now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that
13853: they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
13854: last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
13855: night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
13856: when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
13857: and to earth."
13858: 
13859: A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A
13860: sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
13861: blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
13862: and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
13863: 
13864: Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
13865: how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured
13866: Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their
13867: time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been
13868: anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
13869: The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
13870: sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.
13871: 
13872: And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
13873: well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One
13874: of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
13875: the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
13876: self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President
13877: said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good
13878: physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by
13879: rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
13880: a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
13881: orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
13882: human sympathy.
13883: 
13884: "Much influence around him, has that Doctor?" murmured Madame Defarge,
13885: smiling to The Vengeance. "Save him now, my Doctor, save him!"
13886: 
13887: At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and
13888: roar.
13889: 
13890: Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
13891: of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
13892: Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!
13893: 
13894: 
13895: 
13896: 
13897: XI. Dusk
13898: 
13899: 
13900: The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
13901: the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no
13902: sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
13903: she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
13904: it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.
13905: 
13906: The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,
13907: the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court's
13908: emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood
13909: stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face
13910: but love and consolation.
13911: 
13912: "If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if
13913: you would have so much compassion for us!"
13914: 
13915: There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
13916: taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
13917: show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, "Let her embrace
13918: him then; it is but a moment." It was silently acquiesced in, and they
13919: passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by
13920: leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.
13921: 
13922: "Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We
13923: shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!"
13924: 
13925: They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.
13926: 
13927: "I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't suffer
13928: for me. A parting blessing for our child."
13929: 
13930: "I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by
13931: you."
13932: 
13933: "My husband. No! A moment!" He was tearing himself apart from her.
13934: "We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
13935: by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God
13936: will raise up friends for her, as He did for me."
13937: 
13938: Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both
13939: of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:
13940: 
13941: "No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel
13942: to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what
13943: you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We
13944: know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for
13945: her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and
13946: duty. Heaven be with you!"
13947: 
13948: Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,
13949: and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
13950: 
13951: "It could not be otherwise," said the prisoner. "All things have worked
13952: together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to
13953: discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence
13954: near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in
13955: nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven
13956: bless you!"
13957: 
13958: As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him
13959: with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
13960: with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting
13961: smile. As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head
13962: lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
13963: feet.
13964: 
13965: Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
13966: Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
13967: with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
13968: Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a
13969: flush of pride in it.
13970: 
13971: "Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight."
13972: 
13973: He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
13974: coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
13975: beside the driver.
13976: 
13977: When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
13978: many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
13979: the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up
13980: the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where
13981: her child and Miss Pross wept over her.
13982: 
13983: "Don't recall her to herself," he said, softly, to the latter, "she is
13984: better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints."
13985: 
13986: "Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!" cried little Lucie, springing up and
13987: throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. "Now that
13988: you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
13989: save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who
13990: love her, bear to see her so?"
13991: 
13992: He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He
13993: put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.
13994: 
13995: "Before I go," he said, and paused--"I may kiss her?"
13996: 
13997: It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
13998: with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to
13999: him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a
14000: handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life you love."
14001: 
14002: When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry
14003: and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:
14004: 
14005: "You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least
14006: be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to
14007: you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?"
14008: 
14009: "Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
14010: strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did." He returned the
14011: answer in great trouble, and very slowly.
14012: 
14013: "Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few
14014: and short, but try."
14015: 
14016: "I intend to try. I will not rest a moment."
14017: 
14018: "That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before
14019: now--though never," he added, with a smile and a sigh together, "such
14020: great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse
14021: it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
14022: were not."
14023: 
14024: "I will go," said Doctor Manette, "to the Prosecutor and the President
14025: straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will
14026: write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no
14027: one will be accessible until dark."
14028: 
14029: "That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the
14030: forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you
14031: speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen
14032: these dread powers, Doctor Manette?"
14033: 
14034: "Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
14035: this."
14036: 
14037: "It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I
14038: go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
14039: our friend or from yourself?"
14040: 
14041: "Yes."
14042: 
14043: "May you prosper!"
14044: 
14045: Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the
14046: shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.
14047: 
14048: "I have no hope," said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
14049: 
14050: "Nor have I."
14051: 
14052: "If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
14053: him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's
14054: to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
14055: court."
14056: 
14057: "And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound."
14058: 
14059: Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.
14060: 
14061: "Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve. I encouraged
14062: Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
14063: consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly
14064: thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her."
14065: 
14066: "Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are right.
14067: But he will perish; there is no real hope."
14068: 
14069: "Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton.
14070: 
14071: And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.
14072: 
14073: 
14074: 
14075: 
14076: XII. Darkness
14077: 
14078: 
14079: Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. "At
14080: Tellson's banking-house at nine," he said, with a musing face. "Shall I
14081: do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
14082: these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
14083: precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
14084: Let me think it out!"
14085: 
14086: Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a
14087: turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought
14088: in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was
14089: confirmed. "It is best," he said, finally resolved, "that these people
14090: should know there is such a man as I here." And he turned his face
14091: towards Saint Antoine.
14092: 
14093: Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in
14094: the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city
14095: well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained
14096: its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined
14097: at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the
14098: first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he
14099: had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
14100: dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had
14101: done with it.
14102: 
14103: It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out
14104: into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
14105: stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
14106: the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
14107: his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.
14108: 
14109: There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the
14110: restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon
14111: the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
14112: Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
14113: a regular member of the establishment.
14114: 
14115: As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
14116: French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
14117: glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
14118: to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.
14119: 
14120: He repeated what he had already said.
14121: 
14122: "English?" asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
14123: eyebrows.
14124: 
14125: After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were
14126: slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign
14127: accent. "Yes, madame, yes. I am English!"
14128: 
14129: Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
14130: took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
14131: meaning, he heard her say, "I swear to you, like Evremonde!"
14132: 
14133: Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.
14134: 
14135: "How?"
14136: 
14137: "Good evening."
14138: 
14139: "Oh! Good evening, citizen," filling his glass. "Ah! and good wine. I
14140: drink to the Republic."
14141: 
14142: Defarge went back to the counter, and said, "Certainly, a little like."
14143: Madame sternly retorted, "I tell you a good deal like." Jacques Three
14144: pacifically remarked, "He is so much in your mind, see you, madame."
14145: The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes, my faith! And you
14146: are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
14147: to-morrow!"
14148: 
14149: Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow
14150: forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
14151: their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
14152: of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
14153: disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
14154: their conversation.
14155: 
14156: "It is true what madame says," observed Jacques Three. "Why stop? There
14157: is great force in that. Why stop?"
14158: 
14159: "Well, well," reasoned Defarge, "but one must stop somewhere. After all,
14160: the question is still where?"
14161: 
14162: "At extermination," said madame.
14163: 
14164: "Magnificent!" croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
14165: approved.
14166: 
14167: "Extermination is good doctrine, my wife," said Defarge, rather
14168: troubled; "in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has
14169: suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
14170: the paper was read."
14171: 
14172: "I have observed his face!" repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.
14173: "Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the
14174: face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!"
14175: 
14176: "And you have observed, my wife," said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,
14177: "the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!"
14178: 
14179: "I have observed his daughter," repeated madame; "yes, I have observed
14180: his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I
14181: have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and
14182: I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
14183: finger--!" She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on
14184: his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as
14185: if the axe had dropped.
14186: 
14187: "The citizeness is superb!" croaked the Juryman.
14188: 
14189: "She is an Angel!" said The Vengeance, and embraced her.
14190: 
14191: "As to thee," pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, "if it
14192: depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
14193: man even now."
14194: 
14195: "No!" protested Defarge. "Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I
14196: would leave the matter there. I say, stop there."
14197: 
14198: "See you then, Jacques," said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; "and see you,
14199: too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as
14200: tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,
14201: doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so."
14202: 
14203: "It is so," assented Defarge, without being asked.
14204: 
14205: "In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
14206: this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
14207: night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,
14208: by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so."
14209: 
14210: "It is so," assented Defarge.
14211: 
14212: "That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is
14213: burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
14214: those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is
14215: that so."
14216: 
14217: "It is so," assented Defarge again.
14218: 
14219: "I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two
14220: hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up
14221: among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured
14222: by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my
14223: family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
14224: was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child
14225: was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,
14226: those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things
14227: descends to me!' Ask him, is that so."
14228: 
14229: "It is so," assented Defarge once more.
14230: 
14231: "Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop," returned madame; "but don't
14232: tell me."
14233: 
14234: Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
14235: of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing
14236: her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
14237: a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
14238: only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. "Tell
14239: the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!"
14240: 
14241: Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer
14242: paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as
14243: a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge
14244: took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.
14245: The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might
14246: be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
14247: deep.
14248: 
14249: But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
14250: prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
14251: himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman
14252: walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie
14253: until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
14254: keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the
14255: banking-house towards four o'clock. She had some faint hopes that his
14256: mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been
14257: more than five hours gone: where could he be?
14258: 
14259: Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
14260: he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
14261: should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
14262: In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.
14263: 
14264: He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
14265: did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and
14266: brought none. Where could he be?
14267: 
14268: They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
14269: weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on
14270: the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was
14271: lost.
14272: 
14273: Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that
14274: time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at
14275: them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.
14276: 
14277: "I cannot find it," said he, "and I must have it. Where is it?"
14278: 
14279: His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
14280: straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
14281: 
14282: "Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I
14283: can't find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must
14284: finish those shoes."
14285: 
14286: They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
14287: 
14288: "Come, come!" said he, in a whimpering miserable way; "let me get to
14289: work. Give me my work."
14290: 
14291: Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
14292: ground, like a distracted child.
14293: 
14294: "Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch," he implored them, with a dreadful
14295: cry; "but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are
14296: not done to-night?"
14297: 
14298: Lost, utterly lost!
14299: 
14300: It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,
14301: that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and
14302: soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should
14303: have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the
14304: embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret
14305: time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into
14306: the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.
14307: 
14308: Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle
14309: of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely
14310: daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
14311: too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
14312: one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:
14313: 
14314: "The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken
14315: to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
14316: me? Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
14317: exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one."
14318: 
14319: "I do not doubt it," answered Mr. Lorry. "Say on."
14320: 
14321: The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
14322: rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
14323: they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
14324: night.
14325: 
14326: Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
14327: feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
14328: carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton
14329: took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. "We should look
14330: at this!" he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and
14331: exclaimed, "Thank _God!_"
14332: 
14333: "What is it?" asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.
14334: 
14335: "A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First," he put his hand in
14336: his coat, and took another paper from it, "that is the certificate which
14338: an Englishman?"
14339: 
14340: Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.
14341: 
14342: "Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you
14343: remember, and I had better not take it into the prison."
14344: 
14345: "Why not?"
14346: 
14347: "I don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor
14348: Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him
14349: and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the
14350: frontier! You see?"
14351: 
14352: "Yes!"
14353: 
14354: "Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,
14355: yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don't stay to look; put it
14356: up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until
14357: within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is
14358: good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to
14359: think, will be."
14360: 
14361: "They are not in danger?"
14362: 
14363: "They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame
14364: Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that
14365: woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong
14366: colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He
14367: confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,
14368: is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
14369: Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her"--he never mentioned Lucie's
14370: name--"making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that
14371: the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
14372: involve her life--and perhaps her child's--and perhaps her father's--for
14373: both have been seen with her at that place. Don't look so horrified. You
14374: will save them all."
14375: 
14376: "Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?"
14377: 
14378: "I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend
14379: on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place
14380: until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;
14381: more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to
14382: mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her
14383: father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the
14384: inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that
14385: strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?"
14386: 
14387: "So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for
14388: the moment I lose sight," touching the back of the Doctor's chair, "even
14389: of this distress."
14390: 
14391: "You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
14392: as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been
14393: completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your
14394: horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the
14395: afternoon."
14396: 
14397: "It shall be done!"
14398: 
14399: His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
14400: flame, and was as quick as youth.
14401: 
14402: "You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man?
14403: Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child
14404: and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head
14405: beside her husband's cheerfully." He faltered for an instant; then went
14406: on as before. "For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her
14407: the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell
14408: her that it was her husband's last arrangement. Tell her that more
14409: depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
14410: father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?"
14411: 
14412: "I am sure of it."
14413: 
14414: "I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
14415: the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.
14416: The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away."
14417: 
14418: "I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?"
14419: 
14420: "You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will
14421: reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and
14422: then for England!"
14423: 
14424: "Why, then," said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady
14425: hand, "it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young
14426: and ardent man at my side."
14427: 
14428: "By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will
14429: influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
14430: another."
14431: 
14432: "Nothing, Carton."
14433: 
14434: "Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for
14435: any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must
14436: inevitably be sacrificed."
14437: 
14438: "I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully."
14439: 
14440: "And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!"
14441: 
14442: Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even
14443: put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He
14444: helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,
14445: as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find
14446: where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
14447: to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
14448: courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in
14449: the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
14450: it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained
14451: there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
14452: her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a
14453: Farewell.
14454: 
14455: 
14456: 
14457: 
14458: XIII. Fifty-two
14459: 
14460: 
14461: In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
14462: their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were
14463: to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
14464: everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants
14465: were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,
14466: the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set
14467: apart.
14468: 
14469: Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,
14470: whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
14471: poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered
14472: in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
14473: and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
14474: intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
14475: without distinction.
14476: 
14477: Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
14478: flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line
14479: of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had
14480: fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
14481: that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
14482: avail him nothing.
14483: 
14484: Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
14485: before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life
14486: was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts
14487: and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and
14488: when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,
14489: this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,
14490: a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against
14491: resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and
14492: child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a
14493: selfish thing.
14494: 
14495: But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there
14496: was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
14497: road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
14498: him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
14499: enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,
14500: by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his
14501: thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.
14502: 
14503: Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
14504: travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
14505: of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the
14506: prison lamps should be extinguished.
14507: 
14508: He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing
14509: of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,
14510: and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's
14511: responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had
14512: already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
14513: he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that
14514: her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
14515: had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,
14516: for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had
14517: become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled
14518: to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on
14519: that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had
14520: preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
14521: he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no
14522: mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
14523: discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He
14524: besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console
14525: her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think
14526: of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
14527: reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
14528: sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
14529: blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their
14530: dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her
14531: father.
14532: 
14533: To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
14534: father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And
14535: he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any
14536: despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
14537: tending.
14538: 
14539: To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.
14540: That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
14541: attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so
14542: full of the others, that he never once thought of him.
14543: 
14544: He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When
14545: he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.
14546: 
14547: But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
14548: forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
14549: nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
14550: heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
14551: he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
14552: suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
14553: was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the
14554: sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it
14555: flashed upon his mind, "this is the day of my death!"
14556: 
14557: Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads
14558: were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could
14559: meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking
14560: thoughts, which was very difficult to master.
14561: 
14562: He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How
14563: high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
14564: stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
14565: red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,
14566: or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
14567: directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
14568: times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
14569: fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
14570: to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
14571: few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
14572: the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
14573: 
14574: The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
14575: numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
14576: ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
14577: contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
14578: him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly
14579: repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.
14580: He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for
14581: himself and for them.
14582: 
14583: Twelve gone for ever.
14584: 
14585: He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would
14586: be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
14587: and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two
14588: before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
14589: interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
14590: 
14591: Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very
14592: different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,
14593: he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had
14594: measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his
14595: recovered self-possession, he thought, "There is but another now," and
14596: turned to walk again.
14597: 
14598: Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.
14599: 
14600: The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or
14601: as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: "He has never seen
14602: me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose
14603: no time!"
14604: 
14605: The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him
14606: face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
14608: 
14609: There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the
14610: first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
14611: imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's
14612: hand, and it was his real grasp.
14613: 
14614: "Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?" he said.
14615: 
14616: "I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You
14617: are not"--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--"a prisoner?"
14618: 
14619: "No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
14620: here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your
14621: wife, dear Darnay."
14622: 
14623: The prisoner wrung his hand.
14624: 
14625: "I bring you a request from her."
14626: 
14627: "What is it?"
14628: 
14629: "A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
14630: in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
14631: remember."
14632: 
14633: The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
14634: 
14635: "You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
14636: no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you
14637: wear, and draw on these of mine."
14638: 
14639: There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
14640: Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
14641: him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.
14642: 
14643: "Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to
14644: them. Quick!"
14645: 
14646: "Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You
14647: will only die with me. It is madness."
14648: 
14649: "It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you
14650: to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change
14651: that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do
14652: it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like
14653: this of mine!"
14654: 
14655: With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,
14656: that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.
14657: The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.
14658: 
14659: "Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never
14660: can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you
14661: not to add your death to the bitterness of mine."
14662: 
14663: "Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
14664: refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
14665: steady enough to write?"
14666: 
14667: "It was when you came in."
14668: 
14669: "Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!"
14670: 
14671: Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.
14672: Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.
14673: 
14674: "Write exactly as I speak."
14675: 
14676: "To whom do I address it?"
14677: 
14678: "To no one." Carton still had his hand in his breast.
14679: 
14680: "Do I date it?"
14681: 
14682: "No."
14683: 
14684: The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with
14685: his hand in his breast, looked down.
14686: 
14687: "'If you remember,'" said Carton, dictating, "'the words that passed
14688: between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
14689: You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.'"
14690: 
14691: He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look
14692: up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon
14693: something.
14694: 
14695: "Have you written 'forget them'?" Carton asked.
14696: 
14697: "I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?"
14698: 
14699: "No; I am not armed."
14700: 
14701: "What is it in your hand?"
14702: 
14703: "You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more." He
14704: dictated again. "'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove
14705: them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.'" As he said these
14706: words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
14707: moved down close to the writer's face.
14708: 
14709: The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about
14710: him vacantly.
14711: 
14712: "What vapour is that?" he asked.
14713: 
14714: "Vapour?"
14715: 
14716: "Something that crossed me?"
14717: 
14718: "I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen
14719: and finish. Hurry, hurry!"
14720: 
14721: As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the
14722: prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton
14723: with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his
14724: hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.
14725: 
14726: "Hurry, hurry!"
14727: 
14728: The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
14729: 
14730: "'If it had been otherwise;'" Carton's hand was again watchfully and
14731: softly stealing down; "'I never should have used the longer opportunity.
14732: If it had been otherwise;'" the hand was at the prisoner's face; "'I
14733: should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
14734: otherwise--'" Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
14735: unintelligible signs.
14736: 
14737: Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up
14738: with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his
14739: nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist. For a few
14740: seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
14741: life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on
14742: the ground.
14743: 
14744: Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton
14745: dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back
14746: his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he
14747: softly called, "Enter there! Come in!" and the Spy presented himself.
14748: 
14749: "You see?" said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the
14750: insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: "is your hazard very
14751: great?"
14752: 
14753: "Mr. Carton," the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, "my
14754: hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
14755: the whole of your bargain."
14756: 
14757: "Don't fear me. I will be true to the death."
14758: 
14759: "You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
14760: made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear."
14761: 
14762: "Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the
14763: rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
14764: take me to the coach."
14765: 
14766: "You?" said the Spy nervously.
14767: 
14768: "Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which
14769: you brought me in?"
14770: 
14771: "Of course."
14772: 
14773: "I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you
14774: take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has
14775: happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.
14776: Quick! Call assistance!"
14777: 
14778: "You swear not to betray me?" said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a
14779: last moment.
14780: 
14781: "Man, man!" returned Carton, stamping his foot; "have I sworn by no
14782: solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious
14783: moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place
14784: him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him
14785: yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of
14786: last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!"
14787: 
14788: The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
14789: forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
14790: 
14791: "How, then?" said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. "So
14792: afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
14793: Sainte Guillotine?"
14794: 
14795: "A good patriot," said the other, "could hardly have been more afflicted
14796: if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank."
14797: 
14798: They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
14799: brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.
14800: 
14801: "The time is short, Evremonde," said the Spy, in a warning voice.
14802: 
14803: "I know it well," answered Carton. "Be careful of my friend, I entreat
14804: you, and leave me."
14805: 
14806: "Come, then, my children," said Barsad. "Lift him, and come away!"
14807: 
14808: The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of
14809: listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote
14810: suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,
14811: footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry
14812: made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he
14813: sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.
14814: 
14815: Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
14816: began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and
14817: finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely
14818: saying, "Follow me, Evremonde!" and he followed into a large dark room,
14819: at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows
14820: within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern
14821: the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
14822: standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
14823: but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
14824: fixedly at the ground.
14825: 
14826: As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two
14827: were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,
14828: as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of
14829: discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young
14830: woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was
14831: no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from
14832: the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.
14833: 
14834: "Citizen Evremonde," she said, touching him with her cold hand. "I am a
14835: poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force."
14836: 
14837: He murmured for answer: "True. I forget what you were accused of?"
14838: 
14839: "Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it
14840: likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
14841: like me?"
14842: 
14843: The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
14844: started from his eyes.
14845: 
14846: "I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I
14847: am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
14848: to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
14849: Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!"
14850: 
14851: As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it
14852: warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
14853: 
14854: "I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?"
14855: 
14856: "It was. But, I was again taken and condemned."
14857: 
14858: "If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your
14859: hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me
14860: more courage."
14861: 
14862: As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
14863: them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
14864: fingers, and touched his lips.
14865: 
14866: "Are you dying for him?" she whispered.
14867: 
14868: "And his wife and child. Hush! Yes."
14869: 
14870: "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?"
14871: 
14872: "Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last."
14873: 
14874:         *****
14875: 
14876: The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
14877: same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
14878: it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.
14879: 
14880: "Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!"
14881: 
14882: The papers are handed out, and read.
14883: 
14884: "Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?"
14885: 
14886: This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man
14887: pointed out.
14888: 
14889: "Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The
14890: Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?"
14891: 
14892: Greatly too much for him.
14893: 
14894: "Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?"
14895: 
14896: This is she.
14897: 
14898: "Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?"
14899: 
14900: It is.
14901: 
14902: "Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English.
14903: This is she?"
14904: 
14905: She and no other.
14906: 
14907: "Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;
14909: English. Which is he?"
14910: 
14911: He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.
14912: 
14913: "Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?"
14914: 
14915: It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
14916: he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
14917: under the displeasure of the Republic.
14918: 
14919: "Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the
14920: displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.
14921: Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?"
14922: 
14923: "I am he. Necessarily, being the last."
14924: 
14925: It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It
14926: is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
14927: door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
14928: carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it
14929: carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to
14930: the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
14931: mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
14932: an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.
14933: 
14934: "Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned."
14935: 
14936: "One can depart, citizen?"
14937: 
14938: "One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!"
14939: 
14940: "I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!"
14941: 
14942: These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
14943: looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there
14944: is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.
14945: 
14946: "Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?"
14947: asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.
14948: 
14949: "It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;
14950: it would rouse suspicion."
14951: 
14952: "Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!"
14953: 
14954: "The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued."
14955: 
14956: Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
14957: dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
14958: trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
14959: either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
14960: stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
14961: sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
14962: wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
14963: anything but stopping.
14964: 
14965: Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
14966: farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
14967: avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
14968: by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
14969: no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
14970: the posting-house.
14971: 
14972: Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in
14973: the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it
14974: of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible
14975: existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and
14976: plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count
14977: their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
14978: All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
14979: far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.
14980: 
14981: At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
14982: behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
14983: on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with
14984: animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their
14985: haunches. We are pursued?
14986: 
14987: "Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!"
14988: 
14989: "What is it?" asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.
14990: 
14991: "How many did they say?"
14992: 
14993: "I do not understand you."
14994: 
14995: "--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?"
14996: 
14997: "Fifty-two."
14998: 
14999: "I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it
15000: forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
15001: handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!"
15002: 
15003: The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and
15004: to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
15005: by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
15006: us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.
15007: 
15008: The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
15009: the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
15010: us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.
15011: 
15012: 
15013: 
15014: 
15015: XIV. The Knitting Done
15016: 
15017: 
15018: In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
15019: Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
15020: Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame
15021: Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
15022: erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the
15023: conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
15024: was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.
15025: 
15026: "But our Defarge," said Jacques Three, "is undoubtedly a good
15027: Republican? Eh?"
15028: 
15029: "There is no better," the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
15030: notes, "in France."
15031: 
15032: "Peace, little Vengeance," said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with
15033: a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, "hear me speak. My husband,
15034: fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved
15035: well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has
15036: his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor."
15037: 
15038: "It is a great pity," croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,
15039: with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; "it is not quite like a good
15040: citizen; it is a thing to regret."
15041: 
15042: "See you," said madame, "I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear
15043: his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
15044: me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
15045: child must follow the husband and father."
15046: 
15047: "She has a fine head for it," croaked Jacques Three. "I have seen blue
15048: eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held
15049: them up." Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.
15050: 
15051: Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.
15052: 
15053: "The child also," observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment
15054: of his words, "has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child
15055: there. It is a pretty sight!"
15056: 
15057: "In a word," said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
15058: "I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
15059: last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
15060: but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,
15061: and then they might escape."
15062: 
15063: "That must never be," croaked Jacques Three; "no one must escape. We
15064: have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day."
15065: 
15066: "In a word," Madame Defarge went on, "my husband has not my reason for
15067: pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for
15068: regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
15069: therefore. Come hither, little citizen."
15070: 
15071: The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
15072: submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.
15073: 
15074: "Touching those signals, little citizen," said Madame Defarge, sternly,
15075: "that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them
15076: this very day?"
15077: 
15078: "Ay, ay, why not!" cried the sawyer. "Every day, in all weathers, from
15079: two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
15080: without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes."
15081: 
15082: He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
15083: imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
15084: never seen.
15085: 
15086: "Clearly plots," said Jacques Three. "Transparently!"
15087: 
15088: "There is no doubt of the Jury?" inquired Madame Defarge, letting her
15089: eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.
15090: 
15091: "Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my
15092: fellow-Jurymen."
15093: 
15094: "Now, let me see," said Madame Defarge, pondering again. "Yet once more!
15095: Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can
15096: I spare him?"
15097: 
15098: "He would count as one head," observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.
15099: "We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think."
15100: 
15101: "He was signalling with her when I saw her," argued Madame Defarge; "I
15102: cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and
15103: trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a
15104: bad witness."
15105: 
15106: The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
15107: protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
15108: witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
15109: celestial witness.
15110: 
15111: "He must take his chance," said Madame Defarge. "No, I cannot spare
15112: him! You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of
15113: to-day executed.--You?"
15114: 
15115: The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
15116: the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
15117: of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
15118: Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
15119: smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
15120: barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been
15121: suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
15122: him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears
15123: for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.
15124: 
15125: "I," said madame, "am equally engaged at the same place. After it is
15126: over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
15127: will give information against these people at my Section."
15128: 
15129: The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
15130: citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded
15131: her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and
15132: hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.
15133: 
15134: Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to
15135: the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:
15136: 
15137: "She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will
15138: be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the
15139: justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
15140: I will go to her."
15141: 
15142: "What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!" exclaimed Jacques
15143: Three, rapturously. "Ah, my cherished!" cried The Vengeance; and
15144: embraced her.
15145: 
15146: "Take you my knitting," said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
15147: lieutenant's hands, "and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
15148: me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
15149: greater concourse than usual, to-day."
15150: 
15151: "I willingly obey the orders of my Chief," said The Vengeance with
15152: alacrity, and kissing her cheek. "You will not be late?"
15153: 
15154: "I shall be there before the commencement."
15155: 
15156: "And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul," said
15157: The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the
15158: street, "before the tumbrils arrive!"
15159: 
15160: Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and
15161: might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
15162: mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the
15163: Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
15164: of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.
15165: 
15166: There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
15167: disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
15168: than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a
15169: strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
15170: determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
15171: to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
15172: instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
15173: heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood
15174: with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
15175: opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without
15176: pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of
15177: her.
15178: 
15179: It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
15180: his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that
15181: his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was
15182: insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
15183: her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made
15184: hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had
15185: been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
15186: she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
15187: been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
15188: softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
15189: sent her there.
15190: 
15191: Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly
15192: worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her
15193: dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her
15194: bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
15195: dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
15196: a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
15197: walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
15198: sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.
15199: 
15200: Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
15201: waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
15202: the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's
15203: attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
15204: but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
15205: it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
15206: escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
15207: Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross
15208: and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
15209: three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
15210: Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
15211: passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
15212: advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
15213: of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.
15214: 
15215: Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
15216: pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had
15217: beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
15218: passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
15219: their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
15220: taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
15221: else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.
15222: 
15223: "Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose agitation
15224: was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
15225: "what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another
15226: carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
15227: suspicion."
15228: 
15229: "My opinion, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "is as you're right. Likewise
15230: wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong."
15231: 
15232: "I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures," said
15233: Miss Pross, wildly crying, "that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are
15234: _you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?"
15235: 
15236: "Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "I
15237: hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o'
15238: mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o'
15239: two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
15240: crisis?"
15241: 
15242: "Oh, for gracious sake!" cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, "record
15243: them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man."
15244: 
15245: "First," said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
15246: an ashy and solemn visage, "them poor things well out o' this, never no
15247: more will I do it, never no more!"
15248: 
15249: "I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher," returned Miss Pross, "that you
15250: never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
15251: necessary to mention more particularly what it is."
15252: 
15253: "No, miss," returned Jerry, "it shall not be named to you. Second: them
15254: poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with
15255: Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!"
15256: 
15257: "Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be," said Miss Pross,
15258: striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, "I have no doubt it
15259: is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
15260: superintendence.--O my poor darlings!"
15261: 
15262: "I go so far as to say, miss, moreover," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a
15263: most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--"and let my words
15264: be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my
15265: opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only
15266: hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present
15267: time."
15268: 
15269: "There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man," cried the distracted
15270: Miss Pross, "and I hope she finds it answering her expectations."
15271: 
15272: "Forbid it," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,
15273: additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
15274: out, "as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
15275: earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all
15276: flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal
15277: risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!" This was Mr. Cruncher's
15278: conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
15279: 
15280: And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
15281: nearer and nearer.
15282: 
15283: "If we ever get back to our native land," said Miss Pross, "you may rely
15284: upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and
15285: understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
15286: you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
15287: earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.
15288: Cruncher, let us think!"
15289: 
15290: Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer
15291: and nearer.
15292: 
15293: "If you were to go before," said Miss Pross, "and stop the vehicle and
15294: horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't
15295: that be best?"
15296: 
15297: Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.
15298: 
15299: "Where could you wait for me?" asked Miss Pross.
15300: 
15301: Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
15302: Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
15303: Defarge was drawing very near indeed.
15304: 
15305: "By the cathedral door," said Miss Pross. "Would it be much out of
15306: the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
15307: towers?"
15308: 
15309: "No, miss," answered Mr. Cruncher.
15310: 
15311: "Then, like the best of men," said Miss Pross, "go to the posting-house
15312: straight, and make that change."
15313: 
15314: "I am doubtful," said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
15315: "about leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen."
15316: 
15317: "Heaven knows we don't," returned Miss Pross, "but have no fear for me.
15318: Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can,
15319: and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain
15320: of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives
15321: that may depend on both of us!"
15322: 
15323: This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty
15324: clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he
15325: immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself
15326: to follow as she had proposed.
15327: 
15328: The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
15329: execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
15330: her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
15331: streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty
15332: minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.
15333: 
15334: Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
15335: rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
15336: in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
15337: which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
15338: could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
15339: dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
15340: was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
15341: out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.
15342: 
15343: The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
15344: Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
15345: those feet had come to meet that water.
15346: 
15347: Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, "The wife of Evremonde;
15348: where is she?"
15349: 
15350: It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open,
15351: and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were
15352: four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before
15353: the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.
15354: 
15355: Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,
15356: and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful
15357: about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
15358: of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different
15359: way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.
15360: 
15361: "You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer," said Miss
15362: Pross, in her breathing. "Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of
15363: me. I am an Englishwoman."
15364: 
15365: Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
15366: Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,
15367: hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a
15368: woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that
15369: Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well
15370: that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.
15371: 
15372: "On my way yonder," said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of
15373: her hand towards the fatal spot, "where they reserve my chair and my
15374: knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I
15375: wish to see her."
15376: 
15377: "I know that your intentions are evil," said Miss Pross, "and you may
15378: depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them."
15379: 
15380: Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words;
15381: both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
15382: the unintelligible words meant.
15383: 
15384: "It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
15385: moment," said Madame Defarge. "Good patriots will know what that means.
15386: Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?"
15387: 
15388: "If those eyes of yours were bed-winches," returned Miss Pross, "and I
15389: was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me. No,
15390: you wicked foreign woman; I am your match."
15391: 
15392: Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
15393: detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
15394: at naught.
15395: 
15396: "Woman imbecile and pig-like!" said Madame Defarge, frowning. "I take no
15397: answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand
15398: to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!"
15399: This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.
15400: 
15401: "I little thought," said Miss Pross, "that I should ever want to
15402: understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,
15403: except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
15404: part of it."
15405: 
15406: Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame
15407: Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross
15408: first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.
15409: 
15410: "I am a Briton," said Miss Pross, "I am desperate. I don't care an
15411: English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the
15412: greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of that
15413: dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!"
15414: 
15415: Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
15416: between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
15417: Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.
15418: 
15419: But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
15420: irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame
15421: Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. "Ha, ha!" she
15422: laughed, "you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that
15423: Doctor." Then she raised her voice and called out, "Citizen Doctor! Wife
15424: of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,
15425: answer the Citizeness Defarge!"
15426: 
15427: Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
15428: expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
15429: either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
15430: Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.
15431: 
15432: "Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
15433: are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind
15434: you! Let me look."
15435: 
15436: "Never!" said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
15437: Madame Defarge understood the answer.
15438: 
15439: "If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
15440: brought back," said Madame Defarge to herself.
15441: 
15442: "As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are
15443: uncertain what to do," said Miss Pross to herself; "and you shall not
15444: know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
15445: that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you."
15446: 
15447: "I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
15448: I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door," said
15449: Madame Defarge.
15450: 
15451: "We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
15452: not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
15453: while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
15454: my darling," said Miss Pross.
15455: 
15456: Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
15457: moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
15458: It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
15459: with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
15460: clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
15461: that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her
15462: face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
15463: clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.
15464: 
15465: Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
15466: waist. "It is under my arm," said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, "you
15467: shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold
15468: you till one or other of us faints or dies!"
15469: 
15470: Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw
15471: what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
15472: alone--blinded with smoke.
15473: 
15474: All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
15475: stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
15476: whose body lay lifeless on the ground.
15477: 
15478: In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
15479: body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
15480: fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
15481: what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
15482: go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to
15483: get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,
15484: out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
15485: away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
15486: and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.
15487: 
15488: By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have
15489: gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she
15490: was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
15491: like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of
15492: gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her
15493: dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a
15494: hundred ways.
15495: 
15496: In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving
15497: at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,
15498: she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
15499: it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains
15500: discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
15501: charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the
15502: escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.
15503: 
15504: "Is there any noise in the streets?" she asked him.
15505: 
15506: "The usual noises," Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
15507: question and by her aspect.
15508: 
15509: "I don't hear you," said Miss Pross. "What do you say?"
15510: 
15511: It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could
15512: not hear him. "So I'll nod my head," thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, "at
15513: all events she'll see that." And she did.
15514: 
15515: "Is there any noise in the streets now?" asked Miss Pross again,
15516: presently.
15517: 
15518: Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.
15519: 
15520: "I don't hear it."
15521: 
15522: "Gone deaf in an hour?" said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind
15523: much disturbed; "wot's come to her?"
15524: 
15525: "I feel," said Miss Pross, "as if there had been a flash and a crash,
15526: and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life."
15527: 
15528: "Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!" said Mr. Cruncher, more and
15529: more disturbed. "Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up?
15530: Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?"
15531: 
15532: "I can hear," said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, "nothing. O,
15533: my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
15534: and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
15535: broken any more as long as my life lasts."
15536: 
15537: "If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
15538: journey's end," said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, "it's my
15539: opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world."
15540: 
15541: And indeed she never did.
15542: 
15543: 
15544: 
15545: 
15546: XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever
15547: 
15548: 
15549: Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
15550: tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
15551: insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
15552: are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in
15553: France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
15554: a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
15555: conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush
15556: humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
15557: twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of
15558: rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
15559: the same fruit according to its kind.
15560: 
15561: Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
15562: they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
15563: the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
15564: toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's
15565: house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
15566: No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
15567: of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. "If thou be changed
15568: into this shape by the will of God," say the seers to the enchanted, in
15569: the wise Arabian stories, "then remain so! But, if thou wear this
15570: form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!"
15571: Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
15572: 
15573: As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up
15574: a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces
15575: are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.
15576: So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that
15577: in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the
15578: hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in
15579: the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;
15580: then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a
15581: curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
15582: tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
15583: 
15584: Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
15585: things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
15586: a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with
15587: drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
15588: heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
15589: they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,
15590: and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and
15591: he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
15592: drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole
15593: number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.
15594: 
15595: There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
15596: and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
15597: question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
15598: always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
15599: horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
15600: their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
15601: at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
15602: mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has
15603: no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the
15604: girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised
15605: against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he
15606: shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily
15607: touch his face, his arms being bound.
15608: 
15609: On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands
15610: the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.
15611: He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, "Has he
15612: sacrificed me?" when his face clears, as he looks into the third.
15613: 
15614: "Which is Evremonde?" says a man behind him.
15615: 
15616: "That. At the back there."
15617: 
15618: "With his hand in the girl's?"
15619: 
15620: "Yes."
15621: 
15622: The man cries, "Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
15623: Down, Evremonde!"
15624: 
15625: "Hush, hush!" the Spy entreats him, timidly.
15626: 
15627: "And why not, citizen?"
15628: 
15629: "He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
15630: Let him be at peace."
15631: 
15632: But the man continuing to exclaim, "Down, Evremonde!" the face of
15633: Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the
15634: Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.
15635: 
15636: The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the
15637: populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and
15638: end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and
15639: close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following
15640: to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of
15641: public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the
15642: fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.
15643: 
15644: "Therese!" she cries, in her shrill tones. "Who has seen her? Therese
15645: Defarge!"
15646: 
15647: "She never missed before," says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
15648: 
15649: "No; nor will she miss now," cries The Vengeance, petulantly. "Therese."
15650: 
15651: "Louder," the woman recommends.
15652: 
15653: Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
15654: thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
15655: it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,
15656: lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
15657: deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
15658: enough to find her!
15659: 
15660: "Bad Fortune!" cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, "and
15661: here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and
15662: she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for
15663: her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!"
15664: 
15665: As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
15666: begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
15667: robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who
15668: scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
15669: think and speak, count One.
15670: 
15671: The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And
15672: the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.
15673: 
15674: The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next
15675: after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but
15676: still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the
15677: crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into
15678: his face and thanks him.
15679: 
15680: "But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
15681: naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been
15682: able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might
15683: have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by
15684: Heaven."
15685: 
15687: and mind no other object."
15688: 
15689: "I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let
15690: it go, if they are rapid."
15691: 
15692: "They will be rapid. Fear not!"
15693: 
15694: The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as
15695: if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to
15696: heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
15697: and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
15698: together, and to rest in her bosom.
15699: 
15700: "Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I
15701: am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little."
15702: 
15703: "Tell me what it is."
15704: 
15705: "I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I
15706: love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
15707: farmer's house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows
15708: nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I
15709: tell her! It is better as it is."
15710: 
15711: "Yes, yes: better as it is."
15712: 
15713: "What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
15714: thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
15715: much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,
15716: and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
15717: live a long time: she may even live to be old."
15718: 
15719: "What then, my gentle sister?"
15720: 
15721: "Do you think:" the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
15722: endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
15723: "that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land
15724: where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?"
15725: 
15726: "It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there."
15727: 
15728: "You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the
15729: moment come?"
15730: 
15731: "Yes."
15732: 
15733: She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
15734: The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
15735: a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before
15736: him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.
15737: 
15738: "I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
15739: in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
15740: believeth in me shall never die."
15741: 
15742: The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing
15743: on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells
15744: forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
15745: Twenty-Three.
15746: 
15747:         *****
15748: 
15749: They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the
15750: peacefullest man's face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked
15751: sublime and prophetic.
15752: 
15753: One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked
15754: at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to
15755: write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
15756: utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:
15757: 
15758: "I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,
15759: long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
15760: the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease
15761: out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
15762: rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in
15763: their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil
15764: of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
15765: birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.
15766: 
15767: "I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,
15768: prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see
15769: Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father,
15770: aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his
15771: healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their
15772: friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing
15773: tranquilly to his reward.
15774: 
15775: "I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
15776: their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping
15777: for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their
15778: course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know
15779: that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul,
15780: than I was in the souls of both.
15781: 
15782: "I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man
15783: winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him
15784: winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
15785: light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,
15786: fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
15787: with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to
15788: look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement--and I hear him
15789: tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.
15790: 
15791: "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a
15792: far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."
